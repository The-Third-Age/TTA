# Victoria 2: The Third Age
This is the GitHub Repo of the best Lord of the Rings mod for Victoria 2. This mod aims to bring not only the official book canon of the Third Age, but also incorporating aspects of the Peter Jackson films, the lore behind Middle Earth Role Playing Game, The One Ring RPG and other fan-made content that fits within the official canon. On top of the LOTR reskin, the mod aims to make the game feel modern, improving interfaces to make the game more clear, and pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the engine.

## Static Modifiers

![Static Modifiers](/static_modifiers.jpg)

Static modifiers are the modifiers that get applied via a pop up on the first of the month, with there being no good way to view them normally. TTA resolves this by displaying them within the standard modifier view, with the icons make greyscale so they aren't lost.

Ever uncertain about the provinces a decision is talking about? Rather than exiting out of the decisions just to forget what you were looking for, TTA displays the overarching area in black, with the targets overlayed in white.

## Installation Instructions
1. Download the mod by clicking [here](https://github.com/The-Third-Age/TTA-Victoria-2/archive/main.zip) or click the the green Code button, then Download ZIP.
2. Extract the folder to your game directory. If you use Steam, the folder is mostly likely `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\commmon\Victoria 2\mod`
3. Go to that folder. You should see a folder named TTA-Victoria-2-main. Rename that folder to "TTA", without the quotation marks.
4. Go into the newly renamed TTA folder and move TTA.mod up one level to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\commmon\Victoria 2\mod`. This file will mostly likely be identified as a movie file by your computer.
5. Launch the game. You should see Lord of the Rings as one of the options. Tick it and the mod should load.
