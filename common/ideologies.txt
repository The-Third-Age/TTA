# Originally grouping ideologies (ruling houses and interest groups) by the culture groups they are associated with
# Change as needed to get the right "coalitions" for republics (speciifally related to how votes for ideologies of the same ideology_group can combine to become the plurality)

# Note, when adding new ideologies (barring special cases like slave or tribal, the following updates are needed (outside of this file)
#	Generally speaking, colors are the color or the associated tag
#	Update localisation/modifiers and flavs.csv to define the ideologies_[ideology name]_active flag
#	Update localisation/politics.csv with the ideology and the _uh
#	Update each of the pops that can support the ideology in the poptypes folder
#	Update the country definitions (common/countries folder) to define the parties as needed
#	Update the country history files (history/countries) as needed to get the right ruling party, starting upper house and starting decision
#	Update starting decisions (or whatever flavor unlocks the ideology) to set the ideologies_[ideology name]_active on the tags in question
#	Update events 14006 and 14007 in events/Election.txt
#	Update common/governments.txt to allow the ideology in the various government types (only needed on appoint_ruling_party = yes governments)
#	Update the monthly update event (# Dominions that are now free) to set the government when puppets are freed

# cosmetic. Does nothing in game except define slaves for pop_types
