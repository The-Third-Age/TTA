# Changelog
All notable changes will be documented in this file.

## v0.5.1 - In Development
 - Political Rework
   - Leaders become political parties
   - Ideologies stay as interest groups, but interest groups are much more specific than "High Nobility", "Low Nobility", etc...
	 - Upper House now votes for a reform when the ruling party has at least 50% of the UH
 - Alignments renamed
   - Good Alignment --> Anti-Sauron
   - Neutral Alignment --> Opportunistic
   - Evil Alignment --> Sauronite
 - Change Alignment cb removed
 - More terrain descriptions and tweaks added
 - Party issues updated
   - Guild Policy turned into a setting
   - Trade and Tax Policy re-added (from vanilla)
 - Reforms rebalanced
   - Reforms are always better the farther you go down
     - This is done because pops cannot support reforms in the reverse (i.e., if you have wealth voting, pops will never want landed voting, even if it makes sense for them to want it)
 - Government Type consolidation
   - Governments used only by 1 or 2 tags have been removed and replaced by the standard generic type
