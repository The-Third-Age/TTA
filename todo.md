# Basic TODOs
Some are obvious, others are not. Just a smallish list at the moment. It clearly should be many times longer...
 
## Map
 - Fix the farm/grassland issue, "pathiness" of forests and arctic
 - Coastlines/small islands, Anduin river oversights along the southern Gondor shore and Cair Andros
 
## Gameplay
 - Actually balance everything
 - Inventions
 - Province terrains
 - Max/Min Tariff/Taxes/Military Spending/Education Spending/Social Spending/Administrative Spending/National Stockpile Spending, Minimum Wage
 - Gas Attack?
 - Great/World Wars?
 - Slave craftsmen

## GFX and GUI
 - Update the new goods icons (horse and administrative services are probably ok)
 - Land and Naval unit icons
 - Update country font to include all characters

## Flavor
 - Event 50005, get the syntax for getting the general correct
 - Make countries end their wars prior to the WoTR starting
 - WoTR ending in 5 years if it has not already ended

## Others 
 - Music (BFME2 for example)
 
## For 0.1
 - Pops
 - Fix all of the broken loc (colors, have ? in them)
