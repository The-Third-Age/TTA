# Basic TODOs
Some are obvious, others are not. Just a smallish list at the moment. It clearly should be many times longer...
 
## Map
 - Fix the farm/grassland issue, "pathiness" of forests
 - Coastlines/small islands, Anduin river oversights along the southern Gondor shore and Cair Andros
 - Play around with colormaps
 - Set liferatings and climates
 
## Gameplay
 - Actually balance out goods, starting rgos, pops, ideology chances, tech, migration, assimilation, reforms
 - Pop reform/party policy tendencies
 - Add rebels
 - Inventions and tech schools
 - Cultures and Pops
 - Reset OnAction event ids
 - Province terrains
 - Figure out how to add `minimum_wage` effect to something
 - "Unciv" reforms?
 - Figure out 6 regions to use a continents (to reskin the vanilla ones)
 - What to replace plurality with
 - Revanchism
 - Max/Min Tariff/Taxes/Military Spending/Education Spending/Social Spending/Administrative Spending/National Stockpile Spending
 - Gas Attack?
 - Great/World Wars?

## GFX and GUI
 - Update the new goods icons (horse and administrative services are probably ok)
 - Change modifier icons to LOTRy icons
 - Change the Vic2 interface to something more aesthetically pleasing
 - New terrain textures (with a more LOTR-esque feel)
 - Unit colors for each country (common/country_colors.txt)
 - Land and Naval unit icons

## Flavor
 - Event 50005, get the syntax for getting the general correct
 - Extension of the Gondor Road
 - (Great) Roads (modifier) able to be destroyed and remade

## Others 
 - Music (BFME2 for example)
 - Country names color coded by good/evil
 - WoTR = world war (literally) between good and evil (if possible, Gondor and Mordor leading)
 - Fix backend (resign screen) interface
