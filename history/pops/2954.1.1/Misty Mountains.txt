# 4 "religions": men, elven, dwarven, orc

### - Population Research
# - Based on medieval populations, especially from the late ERE
# - Reference materiel: https://medium.com/migration-issues/notes-on-medieval-population-geography-fd062449364f

### - Rough outline of population composition:
# ~2-4% nobles ( aristocrats, soldiers, loremasters )
# ~10-20% urban population ( partly artisans, craftsmen, clerks, soldiers )
# ~90% rural population ( ~10-30% free peasants, ~30-50% serfs, possibly also slaves )
