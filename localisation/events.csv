EVTDESC2500;Our ambassador to one of the other great powers has telegraphed home expressing his frustration with the response, or rather, lack of it, that he has received while trying to settle a bilateral extradition treaty with the realm in question. Apparently our ambassador has been snubbed repeatedly by this foreign administration, and has been delegated to speaking to civil servants instead of being allowed direct access to the realm's decision makers. This diplomatic back-and-forth has been going on for two months.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC2501;On this subject I would like to bring up the issue of a merchant, operating out of one of my constituencies, who wrote to me last month with a most distressing story of how trade goods of his had been seized by customs officials in a foreign port. Again, I can only reiterate that further tolerance of these abridgments of the unrestricted freedom of international trade will only serve to compound the problem further with every year that passes.'\n\nAn MP known for his ardent support of free trade has held a speech in parliament today, detailing grievances against a foreign power.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC2502;The $PROVINCENAME$ area has been under $COUNTRY_ADJ$ control for some time, and, now, after many years, it does seem that the citizens of this province themselves consider $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule to be the only legitimate rule there is. This province is now a part of $COUNTRY$'s patrimony.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC2504;News reaches us from $FROMCOUNTRY$ that the local ruling elites have thrown our ambassador out of the realm, and that their troops are laying siege to our embassy with apparent intent to enforce that decision. This affair is developing into an enormous loss of international face, one which can only be avoided through a formal declaration of war against $FROMCOUNTRY$. Sire, how should we respond?;x
EVTDESC2506;According to our peace treaty with $FROMCOUNTRY$, we must give up lands that rightfully belong to them -- and only the ones that belong to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2507;According to our peace treaty with $FROMCOUNTRY$, we must give up lands that rightfully belong to another nation -- but only those lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2508;As a result of the treaty with $FROMCOUNTRY$, some of $COUNTRY$'s lands are to be returned. We are, however, only entitled to those lands over which we have a claim. Any others should, by all rights, be returned to $FROMCOUNTRY$. \n \n §RNOTE| If you took $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ core provinces which are not also your own core provinces in this war, enacting the 'return' option will give those lands back. Be careful!§W;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2509;The past war has potentially shifted our alignment.;x
EVTDESC2510;We have been freed under the pretenses that we become a vassal of our liberators. Now comes the time that we submit.;x
EVTDESC2511;According to our peace treaty with $FROMCOUNTRY$, we must give up lands that rightfully belong to them -- and only the ones that belong to them.;x
EVTDESC2512;As a result of the treaty with $FROMCOUNTRY$, some of $COUNTRY$'s lands are to be returned. We are, however, only entitled to those lands over which we have a claim.

Be careful!§W;x
EVTDESC2513;Since we started integration $PROVINCENAME$, it has become a core. We no longer need to apply these integration efforts.;x

EVTDESC3006;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ patriots have risen up in a neighboring realm, and have gained sufficient control that they have sent word they wish to bring the province back to $COUNTRY$. Agreeing would mean risking war, but refusing would mean angering our people.;x

##### RANDOM EVENTS #####;x {
#########################;x
EVTDESC3600;In some places, the common folk are asking for some money to help them get by. Should we give it to them?;x
EVTDESC3601;A non-ally realm has sent us a delegation offering us empty promises in return for monetary aid. The court is wholly against giving them this aid| noting that only a great fool would willingly an enemy realm aid. What should we do?;x
EVTDESC3602;Our aristocrats and guild masters have been asking to have an informal audience with our ruler via a game of golf. A pleasant day away from court will no doubt be relaxing, though it may vex our subjects. Shall we enjoy a day off?;x
EVTDESC3603;We have the potential to give some our of people some gifts. Should we take the opportunity to do so?;x
EVTDESC3604;A dispute between two of our subjects has escalated all the way up and it now comes down to you to decide the case. Neither side presents a particularly strong argument, but one of the sides is offering money to help decide the case. Should we take this bribe?;x
EVTDESC3605;Peasants are always superstitious, and the appearance of a comet in the sky has caused panic among our people. They are convinced that this is a sign that the end of times is near or that something bad is going to happen in the near future.;x
EVTDESC3606;The court of $COUNTRY$ has noticed that you've been acting very strange in the last couple of months. Rumours are now circulating that you are suffering from a temporary crisis of insanity, brought on by who knows what. You must admit you've felt off lately, and the realm has suffered with very little in terms of efficient guidance.;x
EVTDESC3607;A good couple dozen of new diplomats have rose through out bureaucratic ranks and are looking for new work.;x
EVTDESC3608;Our reputation across the world is growing, and foreign peasants whisper in fear of our might and awe of our strength. An opportunity has presented itself to seize on these rumours to dispell or inflame them.;x
EVTDESC3609;Our aristocrats have become increasingly blasé about their corrupt activities. What was previously only known as back-street deals and hidden bribes have known and tolerated throughout the court.;x
EVTDESC3610;A powerful aristocratic family in $COUNTRY$ had vast wealth once, but has now gotten into financial troubles via bad investments and terrible luck. They've come to you asking for aid to help them repay their debts.;x
EVTDESC3611;The poor have few rights in $COUNTRY$. The only way they can hope to improve their lot is by coming to your court directly with a petition. Such petitions as these offer no systemic change but would have satiate the peasantry somewhat.;x
EVTDESC3612;The peasants in $COUNTRY$ are forced into backbreaking serfdom. In recent months, the serfs have been forced to endure increasing hardship in increasingly brutal conditions. We have the potential to ease their conditions or ignore their plights.;x
EVTDESC3613;Lately we have been looking for painters or artists to try to adequately capture the glory of $COUNTRY$. As it happens a painter offered their services to us just this morning.;x
EVTDESC3614;Our realm's economy has been booming of late, following a long period of relatively low unemployment and a well fed populace. A productive population means that we now are better poised than ever before to develop our land, and bring our realm's economy to new heights.;x
EVTDESC3615;Epidemic and widespread famine is a rare but brutal occurence in the annals of Middle Earth, and it primarily effects those already poor. Famine has struck one of our states, and we need to react.;x
EVTDESC3616;$COUNTRY$ is in a state of collective shock, as news broke today of a foul murder committed in one of our states. A teenage boy who was fishing was found suffocated by a nearby river. Rumor has it that his good friend killed him for a piece of jewelry, investigators, however, maintain that they are still investigating the matter, but that no perpetrator has yet been located. The affair is on everyone's lips, with the word travelling quickly.;;x
EVTDESC3617;A state-wide manhunt has been called in one of our states, as police report that a convicted murderer has escaped from a local prison facility. This unsettling fact has ignited strife between the social classes, and without the manhunt ending soon, there undoubtedly will be death.;x
EVTDESC3618;Reports have been pouring in from our ports that traders have been repeatedly attacked by a sea monster lurking off of the coasts of $COUNTRY$. Trade is being disrupted, with entire ships being dragged down to the depths of the ocean. A decisive task force could be put together to drive this beast by our waters, if that is desired, or we can wait until it leaves the area by its own accord.;x
EVTDESC3619;The countryside has been beset by a growing number of wolf attacks. Indeed, our rural population has been increasingly living with fear of their livestock being destroyed, or even their family being killed, by these foul beasts. A platoon of soldiers would be enough to drive the beasts from our realm or we can wait until the situation resolves itself, though that would have negative economic implications.;x
EVTDESC3621;As the forces of evil continue to encroach on Middle Earth, we must seek allies amongst the forces of good. The Eagles of the Eyrie, with their long history in opposing evil, would serve as a strong friend to $COUNTRY$. Our messengers can be sent to the Eyries in hopes to prosper an amicable relationship.;x
EVTDESC3622;The streets of $CAPITAL$ have turned into a sea of people, where an unruly mob have formed throughout the city. Their demands are disperate and unfocused.;x
EVTDESC3623;The leader of a realm is the realm. When that leader falters, the realm suffers. Recently, the $MONARCHTITLE$ has succumbed to increased anxiety about the future of the realm, a sentiment that the people have also begun to feel, paralysing the ability of the $MONARCHTITLE$ to rule effectively.;x
EVTDESC3624;The Grey Pilgrim, the wandering Istari who roams Eriador, known as Mithrandir or Gandalf, has visited $COUNTRY$. A wave of hope has washed over our nation.;x

EVTDESC5000;In the lands of $PROVINCENAME$, there have beens groups of tribals -- people living off the land that refuse to recognize our realm as the rightful ruler of $PROVINCENAME$.

EVTDESC5014;Ever since our ruler's fateful meeting with the mysterious entity, they have been stating that Sauron is $COUNTRY$'s friend.;x
EVTDESC5015;Following all of our ruler's statements that Sauron is our friend, today our ruler has agreed to serve our Lord Sauron as his puppet.;x
EVTDESC5016;Ever-changed by our ruler's encounted in the Palantír, they threw a number of unfounded accusations against one of our allies and stormed out of diplomatic talks.;x
EVTDESC5050;Our conquest of Erebor has led to us encountering the Ravens who inhabit the mountain. These little birds have a long history of meddling in foreign affairs and they are using their influence to stifle our diplomatic efforts.;x
EVTDESC5051;The Ravens of Erebor can now see that we no longer pose a threat to them, and they have halted their efforts to stifle our diplomacy.;x
EVTDESC5052;We have eliminated the Ravens of Erebor, and they can no longer pose a nuisance to our diplomatic efforts.;x

EVTDESC12000;The black smoke pouring out from the pit, in long, drawn out billows, with the intensity of the smell almost drowns out an undertone of burnt flesh. A hurried commotion breaks out as the survivors of the mine collapse in $PROVINCENAME$ scurry to save what is left of the mine. The seams in the coalfield lie, sleeping for centuries, embedded in pockets of methane. A carelessly lit lantern or a spark from a pick striking rock, and a sea of hellfire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n;x
EVTDESC12001;One of our production centers has experienced a severe shortfall in production over the past couple months, which has gone unreported for fear of causing alarm among the common folk. By covering the underproduction by buying the goods from other nations, we could stop the people from discovering this shortage.;x
EVTDESC12025;While the war rages, every piece of food from '$PROVINCENAME$ is as good as any sword or bow. In fact, this province is producing more food than normal. What should we do with it?;x
EVTDESC12026;A strange fever has erupted among the cattle in $PROVINCENAME$, and the cattle are reported dying en masse. Local healers in the province are attempting what little can be done to stave off the effects of this, apparently quite contagious, disease. While the disease itself will eventually dissipate, the question of reimbursement for hundreds of ruined farmers and their families still requires attention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n;x
EVTDESC12027;The goods produced in $PROVINCENAME$ is of the highest possible quality. In fact, the quality is so high that the goods produced in $PROVINCENAME$ have begun building quite a reputation for themselves as being some of the best available in Middle Earth.

EVTDESC12067;Devastation stretches across $PROVINCENAME$. Crumbling buildings stand as skeletal remnants, their walls exposed and fractured. Broken streets are littered with debris, twisted metal, and collapsed structures. Inoperable carts sit at impossible angles, half-buried in rubble.\n\nIn the distance, a solitary wall remains—a stark memorial to the city's past, symbolizing the near-complete destruction.;x
EVTDESC12068;Towering stone walls encircle a bustling metropolis of unprecedented wealth. Merchants from distant lands crowd the wide market squares, trading silks, spices, and precious metals. Intricate guild halls showcase masterful craftsmanship—fine textiles, metalwork, and ceramics line the carefully cobbled streets.\n\nWealth manifests in ornate merchant palaces, sophisticated trade agreements, and a population experiencing unprecedented success.

##### NATIONALIST MOVEMENTS EVENTS #####;x {
########################################;x
EVTDESC15000;Dissent has been growing among the $PROVINCECULTURE$ population in $PROVINCENAME$ for some time, and tensions now threaten to reach the boiling point after the local garrison tried to disperse a crowd in violation of the ban on public meetings. The situation escalated with violence on both sides, and a young boy was killed when police resorted to violence.;;x
EVTDESC15001;As a part of our realm's racial policy, soldiers of the army have been ordered only to buy goods from $COUNTRYCULTURE$ traders. This is starting to aggravate already existing tensions in $PROVINCENAME$, as local $PROVINCECULTURE$ traders feel the effects of the discrimination.;;x
EVTDESC15002;Avast! Awake ye, sons of slumber! The morning calls you forth!'\n\nA $PROVINCECULTURE$ poet, disturbed by the lack of a $PROVINCECULTURE$ national consciousness, has published a the lore of his people that is quickly developing into a symbol of resistance against our rule in $PROVINCENAME$. We could get rid of the poet, but doing so does entail the risk of being discovered. How should we act?;x
EVTDESC15003;A trade union for $PROVINCECULTURE$ artisans has formed illegally in $PROVINCENAME$, and local authorities have brought the matter to our attention. Shutting down the operations of the Union is necessary to avoid a complete halt to output in the province, but doing so might cause aggravations, how should we proceed?;;x
EVTDESC15004;The writing on the wall has been plain to see for some time, but officials in $PROVINCENAME$ now have definite confirmation that the locals are plotting an insurgency against $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. The Army has managed to secure detailed plans for the insurgency through informants and double-agents, and needs to know how to act. Our options are to fight the insurgents in one concentrated battle, or to try to divide them up and dissipate their forces out into the surrounding countryside.;;x
EVTDESC15005; A young $PROVINCECULTURE$ boy in $PROVINCENAME$ has had to learn the hard way that one does not insult officers of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ army without it having its consequences. As he comes to his senses again, he puts his fingers to his nose and draws them back red with blood. The standing army in $PROVINCENAME$ is causing strain on our relations with the locals. We could enforce a stricter code of conduct, but that would cause uproar in the capital.;;x
EVTDESC15006;So take arms! Impoverished, starved and hungry brethren of $PROVINCENAME$. In name of our Lord and in defense of eternal rights, let us drive the occupiers out of our native land!' Local aristocrats in $PROVINCENAME$ are arguing revolution against our rule. We could confront them now, but then again it might be better to wait for another opportunity.;;x
EVTDESC15007;A loremaster of some renown has published a book on $PROVINCECULTURE$ history in $PROVINCENAME$. This book has the potential to become fairly explosive stuff among the $PROVINCECULTURE$ minority, but we are in a position to exert some influence over it's distribution. If we curtail the distribution, only the higher classes will have access to the book. If, on the other hand, do not curtail the distribution, then the book will probably instead see it's biggest readership among the middle classes. How should we proceed?;;x
EVTDESC15008;The situation in the $PROVINCECULTURE$ provinces has reached the boiling point, and leading members of the $PROVINCECULTURE$ communities have assembled newly appointed leadership in $PROVINCENAME$. Citing the proud traditions of $PROVINCECULTURE$ autonomy and self-rule, the rights of peoples, and the repeated injuries suffered under what they refer to as the '$COUNTRY_ADJ$ yoke', they demand independence.;;x
EVTDESC15009;Routine maintenance of the road system in $PROVINCENAME$ threatens to spark conflict, as road sign language has become an issue. While our local authorities feel that using our own language would be best, some voices have been raised saying that we might offend local sensibilities by not using the local tongue. Using local placenames will hinder the province from integrating economically with the rest of our realm, while using our own language will doubtlessly upset the locals. Regardless of which, the locals will feel that all roads in $COUNTRY$ lead to $CAPITAL$.;;x
EVTDESC15010;A committee of $PROVINCECULTURE$ businessmen and traders from $PROVINCENAME$ have approached the government in $CAPITAL$, wishing to lodge a formal complaint with the open discrimination they face in competition for government contracts. Our government currently pursues a favorization policy - preferring $COUNTRY_ADJ$ contractors wherever possible - and this is causing discontent in the $PROVINCECULTURE$ provinces. The committee represents equally the interests of the artisan and capitalist classes of the province, and we could try to sow discontent among them.;;x
EVTDESC15011;A secret $COUNTRY_ADJ$ weapons cache in $PROVINCENAME$ was found broken up and looted early this morning. Among the loot was at least one major artillery piece. $PROVINCECULTURE$ partisans have claimed responsibility, and local officials are now fearful of having to deal with a heavily armed resistance in the event of a $PROVINCECULTURE$ uprising in $PROVINCENAME$. Concerns have also been raised that this will embolden the already radicalized $PROVINCECULTURE$ independence movement.;;x
EVTDESC15012;Some of our guilds in $PROVINCENAME$ have been damaged, and officials suspect that $PROVINCECULTURE$ saboteurs are behind the attack. We have no conclusive proof at the moment, but a thorough investigation might give us new insights, though it will cost us.;;x
EVTDESC15013;A planned uprising of the marginalized $PROVINCECULTURE$ nobility against $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule has quickly devolved into something else entirely. The peasants in $PROVINCENAME$, responding to appeals of loyalty to the cause of $COUNTRYNAME$, and resistance against the rebellious nobles, have risen up against the nobles! The peasant mobs have quickly gained the upper hand in the conflict, and we now have the option of intervening to suppress them, or letting them have their way with the aristocrats. Doing the former would leave us with fewer rebellious nobles, but it might be frowned upon by the rest of Middle Earth.;;x
EVTDESC15014;The signs have been evident for some time. Whispers can be heard on the barracks' grounds, and sometimes, when a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ officer enters a room, even the liveliest of conversations seem to die down, as if it had bumped into some immutable hinder. The $PROVINCECULTURE$ Officers Corps in $PROVINCENAME$ is becoming increasingly attracted to the cause of $PROVINCECULTURE$ nationalism and separatism, and we can prove it. We have the options of ignoring these things for the time being, or getting rid of some of the more outspoken officers.;;x
EVTDESC15015;The hands on the clock point five minutes to twelve. His eyes peer across the town square, seemingly undaunted by the commotion, and the risk. He climbs to the podium, and begins to speak. For hours, he talks. Of the $PROVINCECULTURE$ nation, its oppression, its cause, and its future, in a language that reverberates with nothing save the clear tones of a just cause. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ gendarmes storm the square, and soon he is gone. Somewhere, far away in the city, a bell strikes twelve. A young $PROVINCECULTURE$ nationalist is in our custody. What should we do with him?;;x
EVTDESC15016;Their movements are sluggish. Often times, they can be seen milling about the barracks with little regard for military decorum. When called to attention, their hands draw toward their foreheads with just the right amount of delay. Not slow enough to deserve punishment, not fast enough to be a believable display of loyalty. These soldiers are $PROVINCECULTURE$, not $COUNTRY_ADJ$.;;x
EVTDESC15017;An Arts & Letters club in another realm supports the cause of $PROVINCECULTURE$ independence, and is exchanging contacts with people in $PROVINCENAME$. We could take steps and measures to isolate $PROVINCENAME$ from harmful outside influences -- by, for example, having the Army browse through incoming mail -- but this would of course cause a drop in relations with the foreign power in question. We could also simply ignore the issue, and allow our dissatisfied $PROVINCECULTURE$ subjects to establish international contacts, but that might not be the best idea.;x
EVTDESC15018;A small $PROVINCECULTURE$ patriotic society has reached local prominence in $PROVINCENAME$. Ostensibly claiming to simply organize $PROVINCECULTURE$ citizens of $COUNTRY$ to benefit of the local community, we suspect that the organization is, in fact, covertly arguing, supporting, aiding and abetting the cause of $PROVINCECULTURE$ independence. We could shut it down, though that would cause a fair amount of militancy.;;x
EVTDESC15019;Up until now, $PROVINCECULTURE$ priests in $PROVINCENAME$ have been allowed to conduct non-$COUNTRY_ADJ$ traditions. This generosity on our part has apparently been excessive, since the privilege has been used to spread anti-$COUNTRY_ADJ$ propaganda among the $PROVINCERELIGION$ congregations in $PROVINCENAME$. We could issue an edict to the effect that all non-$COUNTRY_ADJ$ traditions are illegal, but that would surely anger the populace. Should we?;x
EVTDESC15020;In our efforts to assimilate our $PROVINCECULTURE$ provinces into the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ state, bright minds within our administration have come up with an idea to restrict the rights of the $PROVINCECULTURE$ minority, and others, to construct buildings and own land. While this measure will be extremely unpopular among our minorities, it will most likely hasten the assimilation process. Do we want to implement the building restrictions?;;x
EVTDESC15021;Old man Dryzymala has come up with a cunning plan to circumvent the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ ban on the erection of permanent houses for $PROVINCECULTURE$ citizens, he lives in a wagon. Whenever our authorities try to book him for violating the ban, he calmly states that his dwelling has not been standing in the same place for 24 hours, and is therefore not a permanent building according to the letter of the law. Every morning at 0700 a.m., like clockwork, he moves the wagon a meter or two. We're becoming laughing stock!;;x
EVTDESC15022;Assimilation efforts in $PROVINCECULTURE$ areas and territories are progressing slower than they should reasonably have to, and one of the reasons is that $PROVINCECULTURE$ children are still educated in their native tongue. By enforcing compliance to a national curricula, we can foster a new generation of children to identify more directly with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ state.;;x
EVTDESC15023;He holds his hand drawn back at a low angle, as if genuinely surprised at the strength of the blow it just delivered. The suspense is gone now, and he isn't angry any more, only terrified. Gritting her teeth, she says, in the stuttering tone of pain and a foreign tongue| 'There is a special place in hell for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ swine like you'. Those might be the only words of our language she'll ever learn. The next day, the incident known as The $PROVINCENAME$ School Strike of $YEAR$ is in full swing, as parents refuse to let their children set foot in the draconic system that is a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ school.;;x
EVTDESC15024;She makes her way through the city, doding shadows as if they were $COUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers. She's already late, but class is still in session.\n\nAn underground university has formed in $PROVINCENAME$, providing higher education despite the ban on minority languages in academia.;;;;;;;;;;x;

##### CRISIS EVENTS #####;x {
#########################;x
EVTDESC18000;As a great realm it is expected of us to assert our position.;x;
EVTDESC18001;Recently the international community has become increasingly aware of the so-called 'plight of the poor oppressed people in $STATE$. It is claimed we have long oppressed them, and that they long to be free from our benevolent rule. We will, of course, brook no interference in our rule of $STATE$.;;Vor Kurzem wurde die internationale Gemeinschaft zunehmend auf das angebliche Flehen der armen, unterdrückten Bevölkerung in $STATE$ aufmerksam. Es wird behauptet, dass wir sie seit langem unterdrücken und dass sie die Befreiung von unserer wohlwollenden Herrschaft herbeisehnen. Wir werden natürlich keine Störung unserer Herrschaft in $STATE$ tolerieren.;;;;;;;;x;;;
EVTDESC18003;Dispute over $CRISISAREA$ has now escalated into an international crisis. $CRISISTAKER$ claims the area as an integral part of their nation, while $CRISISTARGET$ denies they have any claim to it and insists the state should remain under their control. At a recent conference on the matter our ambassador made several rather militant remarks that greatly raised the tempers of all present.\nShould we endorse his position, or issue an apology for his actions and disavow his remarks?;;Der Disput über $CRISISAREA$ ist zu einem internationalen Konflikt eskaliert. $CRISISTAKER$ beansprucht die Gegend als einen integralen Bestandteil ihrer Nation, während $CRISISTARGET$ diesen Anspruch verneint und darauf besteht, dass das Land unter ihrer Kontrolle verbleiben sollte. In einer kürzlichen Konferenz zu dieser Angelegenheit machte unser Botschafter einige recht militante Bemerkungen, die die Stimmung aller Anwesenden aufheizte.\nSollten wir seine Position unterstützen, oder uns für sein Handeln entschuldigen und uns von seinen Äußerungen distanzieren?;;;;;;;;x;;;
EVTDESC18004;The fate of the $CRISISTAKER_ADJ$ people has become a major international crisis recently. While $CRISISTARGET$ currently controls the area, $CRISISTAKER_ADJ$ rebels and patriots are making a major effort to free themselves from $CRISISTARGET_ADJ$ rule. As a Great Power we have of course sent an ambassador to discuss the fate of $CRISISTAKER$, unfortunately he appeared at the latest summit meeting more drunk than usual and proclaimed that we were prepared to settle the issue by giving all other participants a sound thrashing if they don't follow our lead. Naturally this has escalated the situation, although we can still back down by disavowing his actions, but doing so would be most embarrassing.;;Das Schicksal des $CRISISTAKER_ADJ$en Volkes weitete sich vor Kurzem zu einem internationalen Konflikt aus. Zur Zeit kontrolliert $CRISISTARGET$ die Gegend und die $CRISISTAKER_ADJ$en Rebellen und Patrioten bemühen sich verzweifelt, sich von der $CRISISTARGET_ADJ$en Herrschaft zu befreien. Als Großmacht haben wir natürlich einen Botschafter entsandt, um das Schicksal von $CRISISTAKER$ zu diskutieren, leider hat dieser beim letzten Gipfeltreffen, betrunkener als für gewöhnlich, behauptet, dass wir darauf vorbereitet sind, dieses Problem zu beseitigen, indem er allen anderen Teilnehmern Prügel androhte, wenn sie nicht auf unserer Seite wären. Natürlich sich die Situation dadurch zugespitzt, doch wir können noch zurückrudern und uns von ihm distanzieren, auch wenn das sehr beschämend wäre.;;;;;;;;x;;;
EVTDESC18005;Dispute over $CRISISAREA$ has now escalated into an international crisis. With Great Powers taking sides on the matter the stakes are suddenly a lot higher, should we attempt to press our claims strongly or try to calm the situation?;;Der Disput über $CRISISAREA$ ist zu einem nationalen Konflikt eskaliert. Großmächte beziehen Stellung und es steht nun deutlich mehr auf dem Spiel. Sollten wir unsere Ansprüche mit Nachdruck einfordern oder versuchen, die Situation zu beruhigen?;;;;;;;;x;;;
EVTDESC18006;With the $CRISISTAKER_ADJ$ rebels struggling to break free from our nation and $CRISISATTACKER$ supporting them, we must hope that the arms of $CRISISDEFENDER$ will be able to support our cause. Should our Ambassador to $CRISISDEFENDER$ ask them to press our case strongly, or hint that we are open to a negotiated settlement?;;Die $CRISISTAKER_ADJ$en Rebellen kämpfen, um sich von unserer Nation zu befreien, und $CRISISATTACKER$ unterstützt sie. Wir können nur hoffen, dass die Streitmächte von $CRISISDEFENDER$ uns in unserer Sache unterstützen können. Sollte unser Botschafter $CRISISDEFENDER$ um deren absoluten Rückhalt bitten, oder sollten wir andeuten, dass wir einem verhandelten Vergleich nicht im Wege stehen.;;;;;;;;x;;;

##### GREAT POWER EVENTS #####;x {
##############################;x
EVTDESC19000;Our independence is gradually being undercut and more and more becoming something that only exists on paper, as several foreign Great Powers vie for control over our political institutions. Recently, tensions have erupted over their rights to conduct criminal investigations on $COUNTRY_ADJ$ territory. The Great Powers will have to either assert themselves, or lose influence.;;x
EVTDESC19001;Tensions between ourselves and other Great Powers have erupted in $FROMCOUNTRY$ over the issue of criminal investigations. Our position is that we have the right to conduct our own criminal investigations in $FROMCOUNTRY$, without interference from local or foreign authorities. This position is obviously contested by our rivals. Our choice here is to either assert our position, which will be seen as undercutting $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ independence, or fall back, which means losing influence in $FROMCOUNTRY$.;;x
EVTDESC19002;Our nation is one of the most prestigious Great Powers in Middle Earth. From $CAPITAL$ to far flung provinces beyond, our bammer flutters proudly in the winds, striking fear into the hearts of anyone who dare oppose us. In celebration of our dominance and just reign, a parade is being planned in $CAPITAL$. The question that now poses itself is| Should we invite foreign dignitaries to this joyous occasion, or shall we simply conclude that no other nation is fit to bask with us in our place in the sun?;;x
#######################################;x }
##### CRIME AND PUNISHMENT EVENTS #####;x {
#######################################;x
EVTDESC22000;$COUNTRY$ is in a state of collective shock, as news broke today of a foul murder committed in one of our states. A teenage boy who was fishing was found suffocated by a nearby river. Rumor has it that his good friend killed him for a piece of jewelry, investigators, however, maintain that they are still investigating the matter, but that no perpetrator has yet been located. The affair is on everyone's lips, with the word travelling quickly.;;x
EVTDESC22001;A state-wide manhunt has been called in one of our states, as police report that a convicted murderer has escaped from a local prison facility. This unsettling fact has ignited strife between the social classes, and without the manhunt ending soon, there undoubtedly will be death.;x

EVTDESC29000;This event is here to inform you of the major changes that have occurred in the mod.\n\n The first major change are these "major" events! We have reworked how events look and dubbed them "Fluff" events as such. Additionally, with the exception of this event, major events (the ones with flags but no image in vanilla), now have images and are only used for descriptive "fluff" events.\n\nPlurality has been changed to be "Popular Anxiety" - a sort of reverse legitimacy. A common theme in Middle Earth is the constant push towards chaos, evil and less. As the ages go on and the world evolves, society becomes less and less mythical and fantasy-like, and more medieval. It is not a large stretch to assume that this would cause many to look back upon the "glory days" and become anxious at the future. The higher Popular Anxiety rises, the more unstable a realm will become.\n\nSeasons and weather have been implemented. Seasons change every 3 months on the first, and weather changes every 7 days. Each season has its own set of weather (although some weather is shared between seasons, the options and chance of a given weather occuring changes with continent and season);x
EVTDESC29001;The economy of vanilla Victoria II is built around an industrializing world, while Middle Earth is the equivalent of a Middles Ages world. Therefore the economics of the mod should match and factories have been replaced with guilds.\n\nWhile normally a guild produces one of the non-RGO goods, there are the following exceptions|\n\n§MBurning Pits§! which turn timber into coal.\n§MDye Guilds§! which turn food into dye.\n\nAdditionally, there are two types of §MFabric Guilds§!| One that uses wool and another that uses cotton.\n\nSome places in Middle Earth had significant industries, so Guilds in states with these provinces get an additional 10% throughput bonus|\n\n§MBlast Furnaces§!| Barad-dur\n§MCotton Weavers' Guilds§!| Minas Tirith\n§MBreweries§!| Riavod\n§MWriters' Guilds§!| Imladris\n§MTailors' Guilds§!| Minas Tirith\n§MLuxury Tailors' Guilds§!| Minas Tirith\n§MSmithies§!| Barad-dur\n§MShipyards§!| Pelargir, Umbar and Mithlond\n;x
EVTDESC29002;There are 29 goods in the mod, compared to the 48 in vanilla. Most goods were produced everywhere. A smaller amount of goods helps to approximate this. The following is a list of new goods|\n\n§MCut Stone§!| This good is a building good, akin to lumber. It is made in the Masonry from rock and is used in (almost) every building.\n§MPrecious Goods§!| This good is rarely seen, meant to better represent societies and provinces that primarily dealt with trade. Laketown (Esgaroth) is a good example.\n§MFood§!| Food is exactly what it suggests to be| food. It is a combination of Fruit, Grain, Fish, Cattle and Canned Food. It is needed by all POPs and military units.\n§MLiterature§!| Literature also is exactly what it sounds like. It is desired by some wealthier POPs.\n§MHorses§!| Horses also is exactly what it sounds like. It is needed by some POPs and all cavalry units.\n§MMelee Gear§!| Melee Gear is akin to all military goods that are not Canned Food in vanilla. It is needed by Nobles, Knights and Soldiers in addition to all non-ranged military units.\n§MRanged Gear§!| Ranged Gear, like Melee Gear, is a military good akin to all military goods in vanilla that are not Canned Food. It is needed by Nobles, Knights, Bureaucrats and Soldiers, as well as Horse Archers and Archers.;x
EVTDESC29003;There have been some significant changes to military in this mod. First of all, Middle Earth did not really have the idea of mobilizing the poor. However, they did have raise militias, conscripting them into military service. As such, mobilization has been replaced with raising the militias. Additionally, the military units have been completely reworked. There are 8 total units| 3 infantry, 3 mounted and 2 support.\n\n§MLevies§! are the weakest troop. They are the unit that is mobilized. However, they are also the only unit that can be recruited from non-accepted cultures.\n§MSwordsmen§! are the standard main line infantry. They have average stats, and are useful in any combat scenario. \n§MPikemen§! are elite defensive infantry. They suffer on the offensive, but there is no trainable troop more defensive.\n§MScouts§! are the fastest trainable troop, and the only troop that provides recon. They are rather weak in combat| slightly stronger than levies but definitely weaker than swordsmen.\n§MHorse Archers§! are mounted support troops. Regardless of where they are, they do full damage. Additionally, they are faster than average, making them a rather versatile unit.\n§MHeavy Cavalry§! is the prime offensive unit. They have the highest attack of any trainable unit, and are faster than average.\n§MArchers§!, like artillery in vanilla, are rather useless on the front lines. However, when they are in the back lines of combat, their damage dramatically increases, making them one of the large damage dealers.\n§MArtillery§! is a rather weak unit, compared to Archers, Heavy Cavalry and Pikemen. However, they are the only trainable unit that provides siege.;x
EVTDESC29004;There have been numerous changes to politics in this mod. The most obvious is the reforms. They have been almost completely redone - political reforms are still called political reforms. However, social reforms are now called Burgher reforms.\n\nAdditionally, the Upper House and political parties have been renamed. The Upper House is now representative of your ruler's advisors. A good ruler would not implement any reforms without the support of a modicum of their advisors.\n\nPolitical Parties are now called interest groups - the ruler may wield power, but different groups attempt to influence them. Generally speaking, there will not be more than one interest group of any given ideology. The interest group in government will be called the leading interest group.\n\nAll of the ideologies in vanilla have been cut. Instead, the ideologies represent groups attempting to get the attention of the ruler. There are 5 interest groups| §MServants§!, representing those who blindly follow what the ruler wants -- this interest group is only available to governments types that do not have some sort of ruling council (and instead are purely ruled by the leader), §MHigh Nobility§!, representing the wealthiest and most influential nobles, §MLow Nobility§!, representing the rest of the nobles, §MBurgher§!, representing all of the wealthy guild owners and merchentmen and §MLoremaster§!, representing the intellectuals in the realm.;x
EVTDESC29005;In addition to changing all of the military units, how a realm gets their generals and admirals has been reworked. Instead of using leadership to hire military leaders, there are now decisions to get them (§GRecruit Generals§! and §GRecruit Admirals§!).\n\nThis allows there to be unique generals with §Munique§! traits - traits that only they or select few have. Generally speaking, a realm's best military leaders will be the unique ones that they get from their flavor.;x
EVTDESC29006;In addition to the ideology changes that have occurred, national values have been completely reworked. Instead of being a country's national value, they are now realm leaders. As such, each unique one (that isn't a "Generic" leader) has flavor associated with their agenda. Each realm with unique leaders has a list of what leaders they have access to.\n\nFinally, in addition to the realm leaders, each leader has different traits given to them via flavor, or a player's choices. §MIn other words, the traits that a leader has is dynamic§!;x

EVTDESC30000;Born in TA 2886, Steward Ecthelion II of the House of Húrin was the 25th Ruling Steward of Gondor. His father was the 24th Ruling Steward, Turgon. In TA 2951 Sauron had openly declared his return to Mordor, something his father did not have the time to handle. Ecthelion II, on the other hand, did.\n\n Ecthelion II was known to be a wise Steward. He understood that Gondor did not have the strength to assault her foes. When Saruman declared his ownership of the Tower of Orthanc, Ecthelion II allowed it to happen - Gondor did not have the strength to fight a Wizard in addition to Mordor and its allies.\n\n Instead, he decided to focus his limited resources on protecting what Gondor could more easily defend| Anórien and the coastal regions. He refortified the settlements along the Western edge of the Anduin River, as well as the larger towns along the southern coast.\n\n Ever mindful of Gondor's dwindling population, he recruited outsiders into the army, supplementing his weakened forces. One of such men was Thorongil, Aragorn's false identity, whom Ecthelion II thought of as a son. He never learned of Thorongil's true heritage.\n\n At the behest of Thorongil, Ecthelion II ordered an assault upon Umbar to damage their fleet. This assault was a major success, devastating the Umbar port and fleet, as well as killing their leader.\n\n Four years later, in TA 2984, Steward Ecthelion II died at the age of 98. He was succeeded by his son, Denethor II.;x
EVTDESC30001;Ecthelion II understood the predicament Gondor was in. Her population, and therefore soldiers, had steadily been falling since the Kin-Strife and the Great Plague in TA 1442 and TA 1636 respectively. In fact, it was even questionable if the Gondorian Army could defend all of the land that the kingdom currently held.\n\n As such, a solution was needed. As such, military matters were a priority to him - specifically, recruitment. With the falling population, he could not look within Gondor to find all of the soldiers that he needed. Rather, he expanded recruitment of outsiders to fill the ranks.\n\n Even while he grew the Armies of Gondor, Ecthelion II was focused on constructing defences throughout Gondor. He focused on Anórien, specifically along the shore of the Anduin, but he also spend some of his resources building up defences against the Corsairs of Umbar.\n\n Finally, when his military strength was truly increasing, he started taking offensive risks, but only those that were likely to succeed, such as the Raid of the Umbar.;x

EVTDESC30003;Understanding that a that large military build up costs money, Ecthelion II increased taxes across the land - not just on the common folk, but on the nobility alike. The money needed to build, equip, supply and maintain the growing Gondorian military had to come from somewhere.\n\n Additionally, to help supply the growing military, Ecthelion II got more involved in guilds, local infrastruture and nobles and guilds owning substantial mines. The increased mine production allowed their associated guilds to produce more supplies desperately needed by the military, and the better roads allowed the armies to be supplied more quickly.\n\n Finally, Ecthelion II knew that without a substantial change to the rate of change of Gondor's population, the kingdom would fall as Arnor did. He did what he could to lower prices of food and impose harsher restrictions on those who partook in serfdom.\n\n§MIncomplete, to be finished§!;x

EVTDESC30005;Politically and diplomatically, Ecthelion II was focused on keeping what Gondor currently had. The sprawling kingdom had been losing ground since its peak in the eleventh century of the Third Age, and was truly a shadow of its former self. As such, when Saruman claimed Isengard for himself, Ecthelion II allowed it to happen. Isengard was distant from the rest of Gondor and it was comparatively unimportant to any of Gondor's remaining regions. However, that does not mean that Ecthelion II did not have any diplomatic ambitions.\n\n As with any Gondor nobleman, Ecthelion II yearned for the days of old, when Gondor was at its height. Should an opportunity arise that would allow Gondor to reconquer a territory it once controlled without risk of losing what the realm currently owns, Ecthelion II would grasp it.\n\n Turning to politics, Ecthelion II's secondary political ambition was to rule as effectively as he could, for the best of his people. He had no wishes to become king or dictator. Because of this, he listened to his advisors, especially Thorongil. Thorongil counselled Ecthelion II to trust Gandalf the Grey, but to remain suspicious of Saruman the White. As such, Gandalf was always welcome in Minas Tirith, with his counsel being heeded by the wise ruler.;x

EVTDESC35000;Guarded by the mighty river Anduin, the Kingdom of Gondor has, for ages, stood as the bastion of the west. It’s white walls gleaming towards the Shadow, giving hope to those who pass through it. The Lands of Gondor have long been under siege and surrounded by all manner of enemies. To the south the wild Haradrim atop their magnificent Mumakil challenge Gondor's rule in Harondor. To the east the everlasting Shadow of Mordor piers deep into the hearts of soldiers, nobles and peasants alike. To the north the hordes of the Easterling once more come to challenge Gondor's armies.\n\nEven though the mighty walls of the Rammas Echor and of Minas Tirith provide safety, Gondor’s best defence is its people. Steadfast defenders of their homeland, they have time and again mustered their strength pushing back invaders from all fronts. To meet the armies of the White City in the field is to know fear. As in ages past Gondor's strength is now again tested. As the Third Age comes to a close, and the peoples of Gondor will need to muster their courage once more. Led by their brave captains, they will once more have to wage war in Ithilien, Harondor and in the Dead Marshes. If all fails, the great river of Anduin will be the final frontier. Only time will tell what the future will hold for this proud realm of the Dúnedain.;x

EVTDESC35009;The watchful eyes of the Dúnedain have fallen asleep, and in their absence, in the ashfilled lands of Mordor, the enemy of the Free Peoples of Middle Earth has returned. The Dark Lord Sauron gathers to his banner all manner of creatures and men. Orcs are streaming down the mountains, finally ready to greet their master. The tribes of men to the south and the east swear their allegiance. Through the fires of Mount Doom a new age of dominion shall be forged. Under an unrelenting wave of Orc and Shadow.\n\nHowever, the slumbering Gondor has brave people willing to fight for it, its alliance with the Rohirrim is as strong as it ever was. These lords of rock and horse and their accursed oath of friendship will not stand against the might of Mordor. It will, however, be wise to weaken these enemies, to forge new alliances at least for now. Until the downfall of the sons of Numenor comes, we must be cautious as well as unrelenting. Rumors from the West now tell us of a long lost weapon, one that would give us Middle Earth on a platter. We must return this prize to our lord, may he rule all lands on this earth.;x

The rich vale of the great river offers the peoples here fertile and rich soil in which an amazing wine is created. With the ever growing threat of the Rhûnic tribes in the east, and even within their own border, the Dorwinrim and their allies the Avarim will have to tread lightly. With the threat of civil war looming on the minds of men and elves alike, hard decisions will have to be made to ensure the survival of this realm. Will this unusual experiment in Middle Earth survive? Only time can tell. The ingenuity and bravery of the peoples living in these lands can only be matched by their tolerance for one another. In the event of invasion these pillars of their community will be put to the ultimate test. With their list of allies growing thin the Kingdom of Dorwinion will have to choose each step wisely.;x

EVTDESC35017;Living forever in the shadow of the Lonely Mountain of Erebor, the Lakemen of the Barding Realm have made a living for themselves. Their traders and smiths are known far and wide across the northern parts of Rhovanion. Their steadfast alliance with the Dwarves of Erebor has, in ages past, proven to be fruitful. Now with a new darkness growing in the east this brotherly alliance will be tested once more.\n\nEasterling clans have been pushing into the Northmen's homelands, Gramavuld, which will undoubtedly bring conflict to the Lakemen. To the southwest, Spiders once again infest Mirkwood, and the Snow Orcs to the north continue to harass the Dwarves of Erebor and the Iron Hills. There are even whispers of a darkness lurking beneath the waters of the Long Marshes...\n\nBeyond foes abroad, the Northmen face adversity at home. Much of the land around Dale and Esgaroth is as desolate as when Smaug ruled the Lonely Mountain - the majority of the damage the Fire Drake caused has yet to be repaired. To make matters worse, the Northmen themselves are a scattered and broken people, with no united leadership.\n\nHowever, the Men of Dale are a brave sort. Their King is famous as a Dragon-slayer and their warriors are famed as some of the best the Northmen can muster. The rich heartlands near the Lonely Mountain will be the furnace forging coin and sword for the fight at hand. If this great kingdom can live on into the next age, its cities will grow, if there are men to lead it. Only time will tell if its leaders will be able to muster the courage of their people. Can the bravery of the Barding warriors be enough to hold back the coming tide?;x
EVTDESC35018;§MRebuilding from Smaug's Desolation§!\nThe land near the Lonely Mountain is still affected by Smaug's destruction. Only money and time can repair this damage (especially money).\n\n§MTackling the Wight infestation in the Long Marshes§!\nThe Wights beneath the waters in the Long Marshes have lain undesturbed for centuries. Now, they have awoken to their master's call.\n\n§MConflict with the Amov Clan§!\nThe Easterlings are the historical enemy of the Northmen. Around TA 1200, the Northmen united under a single realm, the Kingdom of Rhovanion. During this time period, they face many Easterling invasions, and in TA 1856, the Kingdom was finally destroyed. The surviving Northmen fled north and west -- some heading to the Anduin Vale, and the rest to Gramavuld. A millenia later, Easterling clans are now encroaching upon Gramavuld.\n\n§MReclamation of Lands Given to Erebor§!\nAround T.A. 2000, when Erebor was first founded, the Northmen gave away the territories north of Dale and south of the Grey Mountains to the Longbeards. Should we turn to the darkness, or the Dwarves turn dark (while we still support the light), we will have a chance to reclaim these lands.\n\n§MExpanding outside of Gramavuld (§RWe must have successfully reunited Gramavuld§!§M)§!\nWith the Northmen of Gramamvuld consolidated under one banner, the Barding gaze turns both east and south, looking to regain territory lost 1000 years ago, and punish the descendents of those who persecuted them.;x
EVTDESC35019;§MBard I§! (initial leader)\nCanonically reigning from the foundation of the Kingdom of Dale in TA 2944, King Bard I, the Dragon-slayer, is the namesake of the word "Barding", which came to describe both the Kingdom of Dale and its people. He ruled until his death in TA 2977.\n\n§MBain I§! (historical)\nReigning from TA 2977 to TA 3007, Bain's I rule was rule cemented Barding contol over Gramavuld and the southern shores of the Celduin.\n\n§MBrand I§! (historical)\nRuling from TA 3007 to TA 3019, Brand I led the Barding Realm throughout much of the War of the Ring. He would refuse an offer by Sauron, leading to his own death defending Dale from Easterlings. Dale would end up being sacked, but his son, Bard II took his revenge.\n\n§MBard II§! (historical)\nBard II ruled from his father's death in battle in TA 3019 until an unknown year in the Fourth Age. He broke the siege of the Lonely Mountain (after Dale was sacked and Brand I killed) and become a strong ally to the Reunited Kingdom;x
EVTDESC35041;Guarding the upper vale of the mighty Anduin from shadow, the Sons of Beorn, as the Beornings like to call themselves, have show to be a steadfast ally to the free peoples of Middle Earth. Their ways are forgotten to most outside their borders, their people relegated to stories from far away lands. Even so, it is by their hands that the passes through the Misty Mountains remain open. Through their courage the shadow of Mirkwood is held at bay. Even though their armies are not large, their warriors fight with a fanatic ferrosity. Their armour is weak and yet they keep their lands and their families safe. Forever cultivating the lands east and west of the Anduin. Nestled between the orc infested mountains and shadow filled forests their hearts remain unchanged. To fight the beornings on an open field is to see bravery incarnate. The times have once again grown dark and only time will tell how long the Beornings will hold off the darkness. It would be wise to search for allies in these times of reborn strife.;x

EVTDESC40000;We now have the a choice in front of us| do we want to be able to recruit more leaders sooner and take average leaders, or do we want to recruit better leaders now, and have to wait longer before recruiting again?\n\nIf you recruit average leaders, you will have to wait 2 years before being able to recruit again. However, if you recruit better leaders, you will have to wait 5 years.\n\nAdditionally, you recruit 5 leaders when choosing average leaders, compared to 3 better leaders.;x

##### GONDOR EVENTS #####;x {
#########################;x
EVTDESC50000;As we have been restructuring the fiefdoms in our realm, the question now falls to the Isle of Tolfalas. Should we directly annex it, ignoring the claims of §GThe Principality of Dol Amroth§!? Or, should we instead give it to Dol Amroth (§BHistorical Option§!);x
EVTDESC50001;Insulted by our annexation of Tolfalas, §RDol Amroth§! has succeeded from our Kingdom. Clearly this cannot be tolerated.;x
EVTDESC50002;The §RKingdom of Gondor§! has been defeated. We took advantage of their weakness, and redeemed ourselves of their insult. Not only are we free, but our agreed upon truce has given us our claimed island of Tolfalas. Beyond that, Gondor has renouced their claims to all of our land, ensuring our independence.\n\n We have no relations with Gondor anymore, which may prove to be a weakness in the future, unless our minds turn darker...;x
EVTDESC50003;The Amrothian fools thought that they could declare independence just because they felt like we had insulted them. That's not how diplomatic relations work. For their insolence, their lands belong to us now, with the heads of their precious princes hanging off of Dol Amroth's ramparts.;x
EVTDESC50004;In their attempts to centralize their kingdom, the §GKingdom of Gondor§! has informed us that our Principality will lose it's status as an autonomous princedom within the kingdom. They plan to annex us. How should we respond?;x
EVTDESC50005;The Amrothians, after much discussion, have agreed to our terms. Obviously, for their wisdom, they will be rewarded, with their leaders keeping their high ranks within our great kingdom.;x
EVTDESC50006;The Amrothians have refused our offer! Somehow, they felt that we had insulted them by telling them of our centralization plans. In either case, they are our vassal, and do not dictate terms. §RTo war§!!;x
EVTDESC50007;Today, it was announced that Adrahil has had a son, named Imrahil. He will surely become one of our great leaders some day.\n\n§RIn 16 years, Imrahil will come of age, be eligible to lead Belfalas and her armies.§!;x
EVTDESC50008;As planned, today Denethor of the House of Húrin, son of Ruling Steward Ecthelion II and the heir apparent to the Realm, married Finduilas, second Daughter of Adrahil II of Dol Amroth. This wedding will undoubtedly will bring the realms of Gondor and Dol Amroth closer together.;x
EVTDESC50010;It was announced that today, Denethor and Finduilas gave birth to their first son, Boromir. With the line now secured, the future of the Kingdom is assured.\n\n§RIn 16 years, Boromir will come of age, be eligible to lead Gondor and Gondor's armies.§!;x
EVTDESC50011;Today, a second son was born to Denethor and Finduilas. The realm rejoices!\n\n§RIn 16 years, Faramir will come of age, be eligible to lead Gondor and her armies.§!;x
EVTDESC50012;Warriors from all over the free realms have been travelling to Gondor as part of Ecthelion II's military recruitment. One such warrior, Thorongil, has proven himself to be a most loyal retainer. His skill and loyalty has earned him a place among the advisors of the Steward.;x
EVTDESC50013;Dol Calemir was a small town situated on the Serni river between Minas Brethil and Pelargir. Until the late Third Age, there was no wall, and no forifications of any kind. Upon the construction of the castle, the town was fortified, and took the name of Lornost.;x
EVTDESC50014;Today, jugglers from Cabed Angren came to our capital and had a marvelous performance. Our leader, impressed with their skill, commended them and their town for their ability and school.;x
EVTDESC50015;Word has reached us of a successful ambush in Ithilen. The Ithilien Rangers we able to kill hundreds of troops of the Enemy as they pass through Ithilien to their mustering grounds.;x
EVTDESC50016;There have been whispers of a long-dreaded fear - the possibility of a second civil war. The first left Gondor with thousands dead, a ruined economy, and a destroyed land. What would a second one do?;x
EVTDESC50017;The whispers have rung true today when we received word that a group of nobles, calling themselves the "Council of Gondor", have declared our leadership invalid, and laid a claim to the rule of Gondor. They cater to the old ways, and are even calling their rebellion by an ancient name for Gondor. Obviously we cannot allow these lies to go unanswered. To arms!;x
EVTDESC50018;Every year, an expedition of the healers from Minas Tirith's Houses of Healing come to Imloth Melui to collect flowers and herbs. These plants are then used in various pultices and other medical practices, helping to heal those who are sick and injured.;x
EVTDESC50019;We have neighbors who are of the same alignment as us. It has been suggested that we host a diplomatic feast in the Merethrond, the Great Hall of Feasts in Minas Tirith.;x
EVTDESC50020;*Casually eating stew. Sees something flicking in the distance. Look at it and see a large flame burning. Stand up and stare at it just to be certain. Accidentally pour out all of your stew. Completely forget about your stew and run to tell the king that...*\n\nThe Beacons of Minas Tirith! The Beacons are lit! Gondor calls for aid.;x
EVTDESC50021;It is a sad day in $COUNTRY$. The bells of $CAPITAL$ rang at dawn, and it was announce that our leader, Ecthelion II has moved from this world. A day of mourning has been declared.;x
EVTDESC50022;Our ally $FROMCOUNTRY$ has invited us to the coronation of their next leader. Should we attend?;x
EVTDESC50023;It has been 7 days since the death of Ecthelion II. The preparations have been completed, and our guests have arrived. Let the coronation commence!;x
EVTDESC50024;The Lord of Lossarnach, Farlong, has died. His son, Forlong, is expected to become the new Lord of Lossarnach.;x
EVTDESC50026;The Lord of Lamedon, Asgon, has died. His son, Angbor, is expected to become the new Lord of Lamedon.;x
EVTDESC50028;The Lord of the Ringló Vale, Borhador has died. His son, Dervorin, is expected to become the new Lord of the Ringló Vale.;x
EVTDESC50030;The Lord of the Blackroot Vale, Duinmir, has died. His son, Duinhir, is expected to become the new Lord of the Blackroot Vale.;x
EVTDESC50032;The Lord of Pinnath Gelin, Hirgon, has died. His son, Hirluin, is expected to become the new Lord of Pinnath Gelin.;x
EVTDESC50034;The Lord of Anfalas, Gundor, has died. His son, Golasgil, is expected to become the new Lord of Anfalas.;x
EVTDESC50036;Two of the Noble Houses of our realm have an argument that they seem unable to solve independently. With which side should we agree?;x
EVTDESC50037;Dallok is a popular team game in our realm. Each player was outfitted with a glove of cotton and leather over the left hand and a short bat in the right. With five players per team, the object was to knock a wooden ball through a gate. This year, there are two great teams from §B$PROVINCENAME$§!, and the fierce competition is bringing fans from around the province.;x
EVTDESC50038;We have finished construction of a nearby outpost and can now claim the surrounding area as part of Harondor!;x
EVTDESC50039;Some of our provinces are Harondor's cores. These provinces don't have too many Gondorians, and Harondor will want them back.;x
EVTDESC50040;What was once a small sheepherders guild in the rolling hills of Pinnath Gelin has now spread across all of Anfalas. The Mesta was all but unheard of 50 years ago, but is now one of the things recent travellers from the region will always talk about.;x
EVTDESC50041;Now that we have complete control over both Andrast and Anfalas, the question of the status of Andrast has been asked. In the past, Andrast was considered it's own province (§BHistorical Option§!), but in more recent times, it has been considered part of Anfalas.;x
EVTDESC50042;Fishers in $PROVINCENAME$ have claimed yet another sighting of the water-drake, Eärcaraxë. They claim that it lives below the Isle of the Úlond, but no expedition has ever found any evidence of the farmer's claims.;x
EVTDESC50043;There has never been a defined border between Andrast and Drúwaith Iaur. Now that we fully control both regions, let's make this decision.;x
EVTDESC50044;After 10 years of construction, our new fortifications along the Anduin Crossings have been completed.;x
EVTDESC50045;We have lost all Anduin Crossings, and as such, cannot complete constructions;x
EVTDESC50046;After 5 years of construction, the Great Wall of the Outer Circle, the Rammas Echor, has been completed.;x
EVTDESC50047;We have lost control of the Pelennor, and as such, cannot finish construction of the Rammas Echor.;x
EVTDESC50048;With Minas Tirith surrounded and besieged, the morale of our Steward - and Gondor overall - is at an all time low. With the losses already taken, especially that of Boromir, his spirit is broken. He is no longer the strong leader Gondor once had - the one Gondor now needs. He is a shell of his old self, and now believes that death is all that awaits those within the city.\n\nConvinced he is to be the last Steward of Gondor, Ruling or not, Steward Denethor douses himself in oil, and lights it aflame, like the Heathen Kings of Old...;x
EVTDESC50049;Ruling Steward Denethor II has died. The realm is in shock, and awaits our new leader.;x
EVTDESC50050;After 5 years of construction, the fortifications of Pelargir have finished;x
EVTDESC50051;We have lost control of Pelargir, and as such, cannot finish construction of the fortifications.;x
EVTDESC50052;Boromir has come of age, and is now eligible to lead $COUNTRY$ and her armies.;x
EVTDESC50053;Faramir has come of age, and is now eligible to lead $COUNTRY$ and her armies.;x
EVTDESC50054;Imrahil has come of age, and is now eligible to lead $COUNTRY$ and her armies.\n\n§RImrahil is only eligible to lead the realm if you are Belfalas/Dol Amroth§!;x
EVTDESC50055;A ranger has quickly risen through the ranks due to their leadership, tactics and combat ability.\n\nMade up for the movies, Madril was a ranger lieutenant, essentially operating as Faramir's right hand man in Ithilien. He fought in every skirmish Faramir was present at in Ithilien, and was killed in action when withdrawing from Osgiliath.;x
EVTDESC50056;Beregond was a member of the Third Company of the Citadel, tasked with protecting the 7th level of Minas Tirith. Their most sacred duty was to guard the White Tree of Gondor.\n\nDuring the War of the Ring, Beregond saved Faramir from Denethor, killing two of his guards in the process. Afterwards, he was exiled from Minas Tirith by King Aragorn Elessar, and was made Captain of the White Company - the gaurds of Faramir.;x
EVTDESC50057;The Captain of Ships is the highest naval title in Gondor. The only official person to hold this title was Castamir during the Kin-Strife. It's possible that after the Kin-Strife, that the title was removed given that it gave Castamir the military backing that led to the Kin-Strife. TTA has decided to take the approach that this title was instead changed from being hereditary, to instead an appointed position.;x
EVTDESC50058;Harondor had been a contested area since the Kin-Strife, and our forces were completely driven out of it in 2885 TA. However, today, worse news have reached us - $FROMCOUNTRY$ has taken over Harondor!;x

##### ISENGARD EVENTS #####;x {
###########################;x
EVTDESC50100;It should be that the entire realm mourns the death of Turgon I, father of Ecthelion II. However, this is not the case. Across the Kingdom of Rohan, to the southern foothills of the Misty Mountains, lies Isengard, one of Gondor's proud fortresses. For two centuries, Saruman has been the Warden of Isengard, ruling the territory as an extension of the Gondorian realm. That is no longer the case.\n\nToday, we received a message from Saruman in which he claimed himself as the Lord of Isengard, severing all ties with us. We could have a measured response, allowing him to retain control over the land - it is far from the rest of our lands, and a reminder of all that we have lost (§BHistorical Option§!). Or, we could show our strength, and bring him back into the fold.;x
EVTDESC50110;An offer has come from the White Wizard in Isengard, now independent of Gondorian influence. The Wizard offers us his friendship and perpetual alliance, and promises to restore the Dunnish to their rightful glory, in return for us handing him our independence. Should we accept this offer?;x
EVTDESC50120;The Uruk Hai have begun to worm their way out of the ground like maggots. With sole loyalty to the White Wizard, these new Uruk Hai will be Isengard's great servants and warriors. Give them swords, pikes, bows| this is the Age of the Uruk Hai.;x
EVTDESC50130;The Orthanc Palantir offers us great potential, and is perhaps the sole reason why the White Wizard decided to take up residence in Isengard. With the Palantir, we can look far across Middle Earth.;x
EVTDESC50131;You use the Orthanc Palantir and cast your gaze across the world. But your vision is clouded and confused, and Sauron of Mordor, using his own Palantir, confronts and challenges your mind. A battle of wits ensues, as you attempt to resist Sauron's influence. You hold your ground, barely, yet the indomitable strength of Sauron is obvious| perhaps it truly is better to ally with Mordor?;x
EVTDESC50132;The White Wizard of Isengard foolishly looked into the Orthanc Palantir. Looking into the Ithil Palantir, Lord Sauron was able to overpower the wizard, and has the fool helplessly in his fingers. We can use this opportunity to extend our influence over the Wizard and over Isengard.;x
EVTDESC50133;Mordor has accepted an alliance with Isengard;x

##### FELLOWAR OF THE RING EVENTS #####;x {
#######################################;x
EVTDESC50200;Today Bilbo of Bag-End had his one hundred and eleventh birthday! One of the largest and most expensive celebrations in the $COUNTRY$'s history, this party attracted hundreds of uninvited guests. At the end of the night, Bilbo gave a speech, during which he insulted nearly everyone present, before disappearing into thin air! He whereabouts are currently unknown.;x
EVTDESC50201;§RThis event does nothing except notify players about Pre-Fellowship events§!. Frodo acquired the Ring from Bilbo after Bilbo disappeared into the night after his 111th Birthday.;x
EVTDESC50202;The rumors appeared to be true. Frodo Baggins, who seems to have gotten this ring from Bilbo, used a magic ring to evade authorities. It would appear that this ring is not any magic ring - it is the One Ring.;x
EVTDESC50203;We have found the One Ring!;x
EVTDESC50204;§RThis event does nothing except notify players about Pre-Fellowship events§!. $FROMCOUNTRY$ has acquired the ring.;x
EVTDESC50205;§RThis event does nothing except notify players about Pre-Fellowship events§!. Frodo Baggins has fled the Shire, fleeing from raiding parties hunting for him.;x
EVTDESC50206;"The Ring is all too troubling to me." - Gandalf, probably.\n\nSpending months in the archives of Minas Tirith, Gandalf the Grey mysteriously disappeared from public view before emerging and hurrying off to somewhere unknown. Upon examination of his research, it is clear that he believes that the One Ring has been found.;x
EVTDESC50207;§RThis event does nothing except notify players about Pre-Fellowship events§!. Gandalf has figured out that the Ring in Frodo's possession is the One Ring.;x
EVTDESC50208;Parties of armed men, orcs, and riders have been seen throughout the Shire, searching for Frodo Baggins, and undoubtedly, the One Ring. Unluckily for them, Frodo has disappeared, as well as his gardener, Samwise Gamgee, and his good friends, Peregrin "Pippin" Took and Meriadoc "Merry" Brandybuck.;x
EVTDESC50209;Four travelling Hobbits came to our fine settlement of Bree a couple of days past. Unbeknowest to the innkeeper of the Prancing Pony, where the Hobbits stayed, this was Frodo Baggins and his friends, who are currently on the run. Their pursuers caught up to them and caused untold destruction in their search, but the Hobbits seemed to have evaded their grasp.;x
EVTDESC50210;§RThis event does nothing except notify players about Pre-Fellowship events§!. Frodo has made it to Bree.;x
EVTDESC50211;A single light in the darkness upon an abandoned outpost. The five Nazgûl arrived at Amon Sûl, otherwise known as Weathertop, to find their prey camped upon the outpost. Had they known about the Ranger in their presence, they may have taken more precautions. A brawl ensued, with both sides getting injured, but Frodo and his company were able to escape.;x
EVTDESC50212;§RThis event does nothing except notify players about Pre-Fellowship events§!. Frodo has camped at Weathertop.;x
EVTDESC50213;During the fighting upon Weathertop, Frodo was stabbed with a Morgul Blade. His spirit did its best to fight the infection, but given the strength of the assault it was under, Frodo fell, and gave the One Ring to the Nazgûl. They fled to the south-east, undoubtedly returning the One Ring to their master.;x
EVTDESC50214;§RThis event does nothing except notify players about Pre-Fellowship events§!. Frodo has given the One Ring to the Nazgûl.;x
EVTDESC50215;Earlier today, our scouts found a small party of five - four Hobbits and one Ranger - in our lands, seeking aid. One of the Hobbits had suffered a terrible wound. We were able to heal him, and, after talking with the group, learned that this is Frodo Baggins, the bearer of the One Ring. This is an issue for all Anti-Sauron realms.;x
EVTDESC50216;§RThis event does nothing except notify players about Pre-Fellowship events§!. Frodo has made it safely to $FROMCOUNTRY$;x
EVTDESC50250;My $MONARCHTITLE$, today we received a pecurliar message from $FROMCOUNTRY$. Apparently, some kind of council has been called, but the message does not state what it will discuss. All it states is that the future of the Free World depends on what is decided in this meeting. Should we send representatives?;x
EVTDESC50251;After arriving at the meeting, our delegation quickly learned that the meeting was called to answer the threat of the Evil in the East. The Weapon of the Enemy has fallen into the hands of a Hobbit - Frodo of Bag-End. Many ideas were discussed, and a couple of axes destroyed, but eventually, the prevailing idea became that a Fellowship of the Free Peoples is needed to destroy the One Ring. How should our representatives answer this resolution?;x
EVTDESC50252;After outright rejecting the Fellowship, our relations with all member of the Fellowship have suffered. In fact, some believe that we are in league with the enemy and suggested that our "threat" be eliminated!;x
EVTDESC50253;"Strangers from distant lands, friends of old. You have been summoned here to answer the threat of Mordor. Middle-Earth stands upon the brink of destruction. None can escape it. You will unite or you will fall. Each race is bound to this fate — this one doom. Bring forth the Ring, Frodo..."\n\nAfter what felt like hours of bickering, the small Hobbit rose up and stated "I will take the Ring to Mordor. Though — I do not know the way."\n\nOne by one, some of the delegates swore allegiance to what would become the Fellowship|\n"I will help you bear this burden, Frodo Baggins, as long as it is yours to bear."\n"If by my life or death, I can protect you, I will. You have my sword."\n"And you have my bow."\n"And my axe!"\n\nAs such, the Fellowship of the Ring was born.\n\n§RThis starts the War of the Ring event chain§!;x
EVTDESC50254;§RThis event does nothing except notify players about Council of Elrond events§!. The Fellowship of the Ring has been created in $FROMCOUNTRY$;x
EVTDESC50300;Our valiant member of the Fellowship of the Ring has perished! They will be remembered as a glorious hero willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for the good of their people.;x
EVTDESC50301;§RThis event does nothing except notify players about Fellowship events§!. The Fellowship member from $FROMCOUNTRY$ has perished.;x
EVTDESC50302;The pass is long and treacherous. Even in the most stable conditions, crossing the Misty Mountains is a dangerous task. Given that there may be powerful forces attempting to stop their crossing, the Fellowship may be forced to abandon their plans to cross the Misty Mountains in favor of passing under.;x
EVTDESC50303;§RThis event does nothing except notify players about Fellowship events§!. The Fellowship is attempting to cross Caradhras. Should they be stopped by Saruman, they will; be forced through the Mines of Moria.;x
EVTDESC50304;The Mines of Moria. There are rumors of a terrible monster roaming the lower halls - which the Fellowship needs to cross. Should these rumors prove to have merit, it is unlikely that the entire Fellowship will survive.\n\n§RIf Moria is owned by an Orc or Sauronite realm, a Fellowship member is guaranteed to die§!.;x
EVTDESC50305;§RThis event does nothing except notify players about Fellowship events§!. The Fellowship has passed through the Mines of Moria.;x
EVTDESC50306;Our member of the Fellowship of the Ring sacrified themselves in the Mines of Moria to save the Fellowship from certain doom. They single-handedly fought an unbeatable foe - a Balrog of Morgoth - to buy time for the rest to escape. §RThis modifier makes you pops slightly more Anti-Sauron§!.;x
EVTDESC50307;The Golden Trees of Lothlórien are a sight to behold after the treacherous Misty Mountains. On the other hand, the inhabitants of the Golden Wood may proove to be more hostile than their abode suggests.;x
EVTDESC50308;§RThis event does nothing except notify players about Fellowship events§!. The Fellowship has entered Lothlórien.;x
EVTDESC50309;Once the capital of Gondor, Ithilien is barren comparatively. Orc raids are commonplace, and the Enemy roams as they please. The Rangers run from stronghold to stronghold, striking as they are able and fleeing to one stronghold or another when they are not. It will be no easy task to avoid detection in this land.;x
EVTDESC50310;§RThis event does nothing except notify players about Fellowship events§!. The Fellowship has entered Ithilien.;x
EVTDESC50311;Ash, smoke and darkness as far as the eye can see. That is all that is offered to the Fellowship as they take their first steps in Mordor proper. The last, and most dangerous, stretch of their journey is upon them. Will they success, to the glory of the Free Peoples, or, will they fall, to the doom of Middle Earth?;x
EVTDESC50312;§RThis event does nothing except notify players about Fellowship events§!. The Fellowship has entered Mordor proper.;x
EVTDESC50313;The Ringbearer has offered the Ring to Galadriel. Does she pass her test?;x

EVTDESC50315;§RThis event does nothing except notify players about Fellowship events§!. The Fellowship has been attacked by Uruk-Hai raiders at Amon Hen.;x
EVTDESC50316;The Fellowship has skirmished with a ring hunting party. In the fight, one of the Fellowship members was killed!\n\n§RIf we killed the last Fellowship member, we will acquire the One Ring§!!;x
EVTDESC50317;Our scouts report that the Fellowship is travelling through our territory.\n\n§RDepending on our alignment and if we have a Fellowship member, Fellowship specific flavor may be unlocked. This flavor will go away when the Fellowship goes to the next region§!.;x
EVTDESC50318;Country flags and modifier clean up to make things better.;x
EVTDESC50319;Gollum, who has been stalking the Fellowship since the Misty Mountains, has was captured by the Fellowship. Upon some (not so) serious thought, they have decided to enlist his help in reaching Mordor.;x
EVTDESC50320;§RThis event does nothing except notify players about Fellowship events§!. Gollum has joined the party.;x
EVTDESC50321;That sneaky, lying creature Gollum has stolen the Ring! The Fellowship, demoralized, has broken apart, and will likely never reform.;x
EVTDESC50322;§RThis event does nothing except notify players about Fellowship events§!. Gollum has stolen the Ring.;x
EVTDESC50323;Our hunting parties have captured Gollum. As we had hoped, he had the One Ring in his possession.;x

EVTDESC50358;Mordor is requesting that we give them the Ring. If we follow their request, they will no doubt protect us. However, we would be giving up a powerful artefact. If we reject their request, they will undoubtedly attempt to claim the Ring through force of arms. What is our response?;x

##### ARNOR EVENTS #####;x {
########################;x
EVTDESC50610;With the Kingdom of Arnor reestablished at last, we must now decide on where the capital of the Kingdom shall be. Annúminas, on the shore of Lake Nenuial, was the old capital of the Kingdom, before it was relocated to Fornost Erain. We can either choose one of those, or maintain our current capital.;x
EVTDESC50620;With our influence and in Eriador fully established, we must determine what is to be done regarding the Hobbits of the Shire. Their rich land is located in the heart of Eriador, right on the borders of our heartland. With the Shire now in our sphere, we can determine whether we should annex them directly into the $COUNTRY$, make them a Free Land of the $COUNTRY$, thus giving us complete control over their foreign relations, or leave them entirely to their own devices.;x
EVTDESC50621;We have received a request from $FROMCOUNTRY$ to be annexed.;x
EVTDESC50622;The Hobbits of the Shire have accepted our request for annexation.;x
EVTDESC50623;The Hobbits of the Shire have rejected our request for annexation. Shall we force their hand?;x
EVTDESC50624;We have received a request from $FROMCOUNTRY$ to be made a Free Land. This would effectively make the Shire a puppet state, though still retaining some autonomy.;x

##### MORDOR EVENTS #####;x {
#########################;x
EVTDESC50500;Since our Lord Sauron's defeat and disappearance that concluded the War of the Last Alliance, Mount Doom has sat a dormant giant, a mountain reaching the skies of the Plains of Gorgoroth. No longer is that the case. Upon the return of the Dark Lord, the volcano became active again.\n\nToday, that activity hit a new high - a true eruption occurred. Undoubtedly, the eruption can be seen in nearby lands, and heard by many more, sending fear throughout our foes!;
EVTDESC50501;The eruption of Mount Doom today sent a ripple of fear throughout the people of Gondor. Those closest to the mountain, the settlers of Ithilien, are those most affected. This once-glorious land, the Land of the Moon, already suffers from brigands, Haradrim threats from the South, and Orc Raids from the North and East. For the past century, people have been leaving the land, depopulating it tremendously compared to its historical numbers. This eruption confirms the settlers' greatest fears that Sauron himself has returned.\n\nMany in Ithilien are now fleeing in droves to safer lands westwards across the Anduin, while those that stay are taking up arms.;x
EVTDESC50502;Since the eruption of Mount Doom, many of the remaining Gondorians living in Ithilien have fled the region. The few that remain are not populous enough to stop us. The region is ours!;x
EVTDESC50503;Since the eruption of Mount Doom, many of the remaining Gondorians living in Ithilian have fled the region. There are not enough remaining to stop Mordor from occupying the region.;x
EVTDESC50504;Five options have been proposed to solve this question - grant permission and assistance to either Harnendor, Harûzan, Umbar or Chelkar, or establish a vassal state in Harondor. On one hand, our allies deserve a reward for their loyalty. However, the Corsairs of Umbar will be able to protect Harondor using their strong navy. A vassal state would ensure maximum control, but would alienate our allies.;x
EVTOPTB50504;Our Harûzani should be rewarded allies for their loyalty;x
EVTNAME50505;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ proposal;x
EVTDESC50505;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have proposed to officialy permit them to colonize Harondor. This will help protect it from any Gondorian enroachment, and reward the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ for their loyalty. However, our other allies in the area will be angered if we accept this proposal.;x
EVTDESC50506;Sauron accepted our proposal for colonisation of Harondor.;x
EVTDESC50507;Sauron rejected our proposal.;x
EVTDESC50508;Now that we have acquired the One Ring, we shall attack our foes and vanquish them once and for all.;x

##### EXPLORATION EVENTS #####;x {
##############################;x
EVTDESC50700;The Lesser Rings were the series of rings created by Celebrimbor and Sauron as essays in the craft, before they created the Rings of Power. Their powers are meagre, yet having a Lesser Ring in our possesion may prove fruitful. There are occassional rumours of their whereabouts. Should we send out an expedition to chase these rumours and find a Lesser Ring for ourselves?;x
EVTDESC50701;Our recent search for a Lesser Ring is taking longer than expected, with our latest expeditions following rumours to dead ends and failing in their mission. Should we sent out another party, at great cost, to continue the search, or shall we abandon our efforts to ever find a new Lesser Ring?;x
EVTDESC50730;Our research into the Entwives has revealed breadcrumbs of information about their whereabouts. It has been so long since they were lost, and they could have gone north, south, east, or west from Fangorn Forest. Shall we send an expedition to find them?;x

EVTDESC50733;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has discovered the location of the Entwives, once thought missing for centuries.;x
EVTDESC50740;The Silmarils were three of the most exquisite and wonderful gemstones that were ever found. Created by Fëanor millenia ago, they held the Light of Valinor, and were coveted by all. The three Silmarils are said to be found in the sky, under the ocean, within the earth. One would have to delve incredibly deeply and incredibly greedily to find that latter Silmaril.;x

EVTDESC50743;We are no longer able to find or search for a Silmaril;x
EVTDESC50744;In the deepest caverns of our deepest mines, we finally found the lost Silmaril of Maedhros, which was cast into the bellies of the earth millenia ago. It is beautiful, the most beautiful gemstone in the world.;x
EVTDESC50745;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has rediscovered a Silmaril.;x
EVTDESC50750;Our research into the Blue Wizards has revealed crumbs of information about their whereabouts. In the millenia since they first arrived, they set out eastwards to never return - establishing cults in the east. They would be a powerful ally if we were able to find them and convince them to join our cause. Should we send out an expedition to find one of the Blue Wizards?;x
EVTDESC50751;Our research into the Blue Wizards has revealed crumbs of information about their whereabouts.

EVTDESC50753;We have made contact with the Blue Wizard Alatar. He leads a powerful realm beyond the Ered Harmal, and has offered $COUNTRY$ an alliance.;x
EVTDESC50754;We have found the Blue Wizard Pallando. He has agreed to return to $CAPITAL$, acting as our court wizard, and providing $COUNTRY$ with a myriad of benefits.;x
EVTDESC50755;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has discovered one of the Blue Wizards, Alatar, who has now joined their cause.;x
EVTDESC50756;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has discovered one of the Blue Wizards, Pallando, who has now joined their cause.;x
EVTDESC50760;Minas Tirith has long been the home of the Anor Palantir. Let's dust it off.;x
EVTDESC50761;Deep within the vaults of Isengard lies the Orthanc Palantir, long forgotten. Let's dust it off.;x
EVTDESC50762;At Barad-dûr, the Ithil Palantir lies, having been taken from Minas Ithil by the Nazgul. Let's dust it off.;x
EVTDESC50763;The tower of Elostirion houses the great Elostirion Palantir. Let's dust it off.;x
EVTDESC50764;Palantiri, or the Seeing Stones, can be used to communicate instantly across the world. There are a few known in Middle Earth, providing their realms with tremendous benefits, and there are also a few that have been lost to the world for centuries. Obtaining a Seeing Stone of our own would be a tremendous boon to $COUNTRY$. Shall we send an expedition to follow rumours and find a Palantir for ourselves?;x
EVTDESC50765;Our search for a Palantir is taking longer than expected, with our latest expedition returning in failure. Should we sent out another expedition, at great cost, to continue the search, or shall we abandon our efforts?;x
EVTDESC50766;We have found the Osgiliath Palantir. It has been taken back to $CAPITAL$ for our use.;x
EVTDESC50767;We have found the Amon Sûl Palantir. It has been taken back to $CAPITAL$ for our use.;x
EVTDESC50768;We have found the Annúminas Palantir. It has been taken back to $CAPITAL$ for our use.;x
EVTDESC50769;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has rediscovered one of the Palantiri. These so-called Seeing Stones, once thought lost, are now in their court, providing them with significant oversight over their relam, and the world.;x
EVTDESC50770;At the very top of the Tower of Elostirion, the Seeing Stone sits, looking forever westward across the seas to Eressëa and beyond. The Elostirion Palantir is cut off from the rest of the seeing stones in Middle Earth. Instead, what all who look into the Elostirion Palantir will see is a tranquil and peaceful land.;x
EVTDESC50799;Following some rumours of a cache of magical items could be found in the nearby countryside, an expedition was sent out to investigate. The mission has yielded fantastic results, and several artifacts have been recovered, being tentatively dated back thousands of years. What is to be done with this discovery? Several members of the court suggest that the artifacts should be displayed somewhere in $CAPITAL$ as a point of national pride, while others say they are useless trinkets and should be sold.;x

EVTDESC50800;Today is a joyous occassion for $COUNTRY$. Anbar Cilgar, the Lord of Cair Andros, has married Róse, the King Thengel's eldest daughter. After their wedding, Róse decided to take the Sindarin name for Rose, Meril. Anbar and Meril had one daughter, Idis, who was taught the culture and lore of both the Dúnedain and the Rohirrim. The couple ruled Cair Andros during and after the War of the Ring, witnessing the Coronation of King Aragorn Elessar.;x

EVTDESC50901;This missive carries the weight of a solemn decision that lies before you. I, King Bard of Dale, send forth this ultimatum, demanding your immediate compliance and submission to the my realm. The choice is stark| join us willingly or face the consequences of defiance.\n\nWhat shall be our reply?;x
EVTDESC50902;We have just received word that $FROMCOUNTRY$ has accepted our ultimatum.;x
EVTDESC50903;We have just received word that $FROMCOUNTRY$ has refused our ultimatum;x
EVTDESC50904;We have just received word from one of the Grammas settlements. They have agreed to join the kingdom!;x
EVTDESC50905;This event is alerting you that we now have a province that has the §OSmaug's Desolation§! modifier.\n\n§RRealistically this event should not be seen, so if you run into it, please report it in the mod's Discord -- you likely will need to provide your save file§!;x
EVTDESC50906;We have repaired the damage caused by Smaug's last flight! There are no province that still have §OSmaug's Desolation§!;x
EVTDESC50907;The reconstruction of $PROVINCENAME$ has been completed! Many come from far and wide to see the rebuilt town and area.;x
EVTDESC50908;Today the people are celebrating Trussell-Day, otherwise known as Thrush Day. The holiday commemorates our friendship to the Thrushes and their part in the Prophecy of Durin's Folk.;x
EVTDESC50909;The boat lift at Mere's End has been completed! Merchant ships are already using the device, and the effects are being felt by the settlements around Long Lake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n;x
EVTDESC50910;A local fisherman has found a large amount of gold in Long Lake! Some surmise it was on Smaug's body when he died, or fell off while he flew and burned Lake Town. Others say that it's from the Master's attempt to smuggle the wealth of the city out during the attack. In either case, the local government has stepped in and taken its fair share of the loot.;x
EVTDESC50911;A new Lord of Riding has been declared. This person is now tasked with defending the vast grasslands of Gramavuld from bandits, brigands and other folk that disturb the peace.;x
EVTDESC50913;The Captain of Erland's Ferry has withstood many Easterling invasions in recent past. Our ruler has requested that their abilities get used commanding our armies now.;x
EVTDESC50914;A member of the Royal Archers of Dale has risen through the ranks quickly due to their marksmanship and leadership.;x
EVTDESC50915;The Celduin Pirates mechanic has been activated. Any province adjacent to the Celduin River (except those with their ports in Long Lake) will gain the Province Modifier §MPirates§! until the realm funding them is destroyed.;x
EVTDESC50918;For some time, we have had an hegemony over the government of $FROMCOUNTRY$. Today, that control is officially recognized as $FROMCOUNTRY$ joins the realm.;x
EVTDESC50919;The pesky Rivermen have united under one banner and proclaimed us to be warmongers. Today, they have declared war, citing claims that we, the Lakemen, stretch beyond our borders. This is blatantly false, and we must punish them!;x
EVTDESC50920;The Rivermen overextended, and we have won! Now we must ensure that they never challenge us again.;x
EVTDESC50921;We've done it! Dale's hegenomy has fallen. Now we must ensure that it never rises again.;x
EVTDESC50922;Perhaps those old wives' tales about there being Wights lurking under the waters of the Long Marshes may be true. We have just received a report of what the locals are describing as a "wight attack".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n;x

EVTDESC50924;We have lost control over the Long Marshes! In one massive attack, the wights have pushed our troops out from the region. We must restore order quickly!;x
EVTDESC50925;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has proposed a trade agreement with us. Undoubtedly this would be lucrative for both of our realms, but do we wish to strengthen their economy?;x
EVTDESC50928;The amount of trading going to Esgaroth (from our trade agreements) has changed in the past month.;x

EVTDESC50935;$MONARCHTITLE$ Bard II has died today! The whole realm mourns, and prepares for his heir's coronation.\n\n§MTechnically, Girion II should be coronated (assuming he has been born and is of age), but due to limited leader slots, the mod team has elected to not put Girion II into the mod. You will instead get a generic leader§!;x
EVTDESC50936;Today, the whole realm celebrates as Bain, son of Bard I, marries Astrid, daughter of Braga.;x
EVTDESC50937;Today, Brand, son of Bain, was born. The realm breathes a sign of relief knowing the succession has been secured.;x
EVTDESC50938;Today, Girion, son of Bain, was born. Despite not becoming king, Girion Bainson would go on to protect and rule the border-town of Austriborg. His leadership would elevate the town's status, making it one of the most important towns in the realm.;x
EVTDESC50939;Today, the whole realm celebrates as Brand, son of Bain I, marries Erna of Dale.;x
EVTDESC50940;Today, Bard, son of Brand, was born. He was named for Brand's grandfather, Bard I, the Dragonslayer and first King of Dale. The realm breathes a sign of relief knowing the succession has been secured.;x

EVTDESC50942;Today, the whole realm celebrates as Bard, son of Brand I, marries Esgreld of Dale.;x
EVTDESC50943;Today, Girion, son of Bard, was born. He was named for Girion I, the Lord of Dale when Smaug took the Lonely Mountain. The realm breathes a sign of relief knowing the succession has been secured.;x;x
EVTDESC50944;Today, Girloth, son of Bard, was born. He would go on to become a tactician and general for the Barding Realm, commanding beside his brother-King.;x
EVTDESC50945;An heir of the line of Bard exists, but they are not old enough to assume the throne. Until this happens, the realm will be ruled by a regency council, usually consisting of the previous ruler's wife and inner council.;x
EVTDESC50946;Today, Bryn, second son of Brand I, comes of age. Raised in the royal halls of $CAPITAL$, he has been training to be a warrior and general since he was a child. When he was still a young man, the Easterings invaded during the War of the Ring and killed his father in the Siege of Dale. Distraught, he and his brother, Bard II, worked and fought together to free their home from invaders. Afterwards, he commanded the Barding Realm's armies in their conquests against the Easterlings.;x
EVTDESC50947;Today, Girloth, second son of Bard II, comes of age. Born just after the War of the Ring, he grew up in a time of great rebuilding an expansion for the kingdom -- Dale has been rebuilt, and his father, Bard II, with the help of his brother Bryn, had taken the fight to the Easterlings. Their success left a lasting impression on Girloth. He devoted his studies to military tactics, and become of the best generals the kingdom had to offer while he lived.;x
EVTDESC50948;With the dust settled and Erebor officially under our control, the Longbeards still remaining in Erebor have come to us asking that they at least retain control over Erebor. They propose to recognize our claim to the land surrounding the Lonely Mountain, and in return, we will relinquish control and claim over Erebor itself.;x
EVTDESC50950;In $PROVINCENAME$, there has been a flare-up of tensions between the merchants and the Fisher's Guild. How should we resolve this issue?;x
EVTDESC50951;When our clan relocated to the edge of Gramavuld and beat the weak Northmen, an invitation was sent out to the other Logath tribes, promising land and riches to those who supported our cause. Today, a new batch of volunteers have arrived in $PROVINCENAME$, ready to enrich themselves with the conquest of Gramavuld.;x
EVTDESC50952;Whereas many of the migrants coming to our land are of their own accord, the newest batch are 5000 professional soldiers from the $FROMCOUNTRY$. With them comes wealth and supplies to be used for our continued progress.;x
EVTDESC50953;Today, a messenger came stumbling into the Great Hall of $PROVINCENAME$. They clearly have been riding for days, with little food nor rest.\n\nMy Lord, I bring grave tidings. The $FROMCOUNTRY$ has dispatched a force to Burh Austris, occupying the region and establishing a semi-permanent camp there!;x
EVTDESC50956;With the end of the Amov Clan, their raids stop as well.;x
EVTDESC50957;The hoofbeats of the rider were deafening. The day of reckoning has come.\n\nAfter months of raids by the $FROMCOUNTRY$, the conflict has finally escalated into all-out war. Undoubtedly the victor will decide not only the $FROMCOUNTRY$'s fate, but our own as well.;x
EVTDESC50958;The call to war has been sounded! Today, the Khan's promises have been fulfilled| the armies of the $COUNTRY$ march to war on a glorious conquest of Gramavuld.;x
EVTDESC50959;The call to war has been sounded! The $FROMCOUNTRY$ rallies their armies to attack us. We can use this as a way to start our glorious conquest of Gramavuld!;x
EVTDESC50960;With our coffers overflowing, it has been suggested that we provide gifts to the Dwarves. Should they share in our wealth?;x

EVTDESC100003;One group within our cultural union has claimed sovereignty over our culture. They have proposed a union of all part of our culture. Should we accept?;x
EVTDESC100005;A more well recognized realm of our cultural brethren have invited us to a council. Undoubtedly, they will want us to recognize them as a stronger realm, formally making us subservient to them. Should we attend?;x
EVTDESC100006;Our overlord has acquired some land that they do not claim, but we do. They are willing to give it to us.;x
EVTDESC100008;We have a generic leader when there is a unique leader that we can be using. Let's use that leader.;x
EVTDESC100009;Thorongil has left our court, and so has his wisdom.;x

EVTDESC110000;There currently are no actions that you can take with the Alliance!;x
EVTDESC110042;There are a handful of diplomatic solutions to this core dispute|\n\n1. We can drop the claim completely (historical), although our own people may see this as a sign of weakness\n2. We can drop the claim, for the resettlement of our people living in the region. §MThe ai will only accept this offer if we have 200 relation§!\n3. We can press for the full claim. §MThe ai will never accept this§!\n\n§MFor both of the ahistorical options, if our offer is rejected, we can choose to call an alliance-wide vote.;x
EVTDESC110043;$FROMCOUNTRY$ is requesting the return of their culture group from the provided regions. If we accept, all Adhalling and Rivermen pops in these provinces will move to $FROMCOUNTRY$.;x
EVTDESC110044;Erebor has agreed to our proposal -- our brethren will drop their claim to Erebor's land, and their people will move to ours. Where should they settle?;x
EVTDESC110046;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has refused our offer! We can either drop our demand, or we can call for an alliance-wide vote.\n\n§MDropping the demand will not resolve the crises in favor of $FROMCOUNTRY$. We will have to wait 10 years before attempting to resolve it again.§!\n\n§MIf we call for a vote and win, $FROMCOUNTRY$ will lose cores and cede us the land/pops. However, if they win, all Northmen realms lose cores on the lands. A tie will have the same effect as dropping the demand.§!;x
EVTDESC110047;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed to our proposal -- they will drop their claim to the land, and cede it to us!;x
EVTDESC110160;The alliance has agreed to an economic union!\n\n§MThis will force us into the sphere of a GP within the alliance§!;x
EVTDESC110163;We have been invited to join the Alliance of Dwarves and Men! Should we accept?;x
EVTDESC110164;The Alliance has sided with us! The initiator will lose their claim to the region, and if we do not currently own it, we will become the owners!;x
EVTDESC110165;The Alliance has sided with our opponent. We will lose our claim to the region, and if we own it, we will cede the land.;x
EVTDESC110166;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has ceded some of our cores!;x
EVTDESC110167;The alliance has sided with us! Erebor will lose cores on the region and cede the region to us, and we will gain cores on it.;x
EVTDESC110168;The alliance has voted to enact a political union!\n\n§MAny realm that voted for the union will be annexed, and we will become the Free Folk of the North.§!;x
EVTDESC110170;We no longer fit the requirements to be part of the Alliance of Dwarves and Men. Most likely, this is because we became a vassal, or we turned to the darkness.;x
EVTDESC110171;Due to dwindling membership, the Alliance of Dwarves and Men has collapsed!;x
EVTDESC110172;With the formation of the Free Folk of the North, the remnants of the Alliance have disbanded. The unity that once promised strength and safety no longer has a place in our realm!;x
EVTDESC110178;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has decided to return our cores!;x
EVTDESC110179;With our expanded influence within $FROMCOUNTRY$, we have been able to convince their leadership to join our realm.;x

EVTDESC150007;With a long, oppressive history, the Drúedain of Drúadan Forest have never been considered $COUNTRY_ADJ$s, despite residing within our territory. The past few months have been particularly difficult for them, which has caused high amounts of militancy across the tribe.
