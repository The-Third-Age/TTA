alliance_of_dwarves_and_men_desc;From Tolkien Gateway, Alliance of Dwarves and Men:\n\n"The Men and Dwarves in the north had coexisted peacefully ever since the ancestors of the Northmen settled in the area [the Mirkwood narrows] in the First Age. When Angband fell, multitudes of Orcs fled east reaching the lands occupied by the Dwarves and Men. The Orcs far outnumbered the Dwarves in battles but their Mannish neighbours helped them overcome the Orcs' superiority of numbers and together they were able to drive them back. Thus began a warm friendship between the two races, the Dwarves supplied them with better arms while the Men, who were fierce and skilled riders, sent scouts to look for enemy movement and there was relative peace in the region.\n\nWhen Sauron invaded Eriador in S.A. 1695, hordes of Orcs invaded the mountains again. Gundabad was taken and Ered Mithrin was raided. It was not only Orcs the Alliance fought but also other savage Men that came from the east. When Sauron was finally driven back from Eriador in S.A. 1701, the Alliance ended. The Men were heavily diminished in number and remained scattered and impoverished living in caves or the edges of the forest. The Longbeards still maintained Khazad-dûm but their communication to the Iron Hills were cut off for some time since the enemy now occupied their former lands.\n\nThe two peoples continued to occupy the same regions and be neighbours. The same kind of friendship and coexistence would be seen again centuries later, between the Men of Dale and the Dwarves of Erebor."\n\nWe are members of the Alliance of Dwarves and Men!;x

This in turn started to draw Lakemen from other towns and villages, and eventually, the descendents of the other Northmen in Gramavuld. Seeing his growing people, Bard turned his gaze to the other Northmen settlements in the area, and his kingdom began to expand.\n\nBy TA 2954, Bard had consolidated many of the towns of the Adhallings, the men living among the northeastern eaves of Mirkwood, and most of the Lakemen, the men living around Long Lake.\n\nHe had made it his goal to unite the Northmen of Gramavuld under one banner. Unfortunately, he passed in TA 2977 before his plans came to fruition, allowing his son Bain I to complete the task.;x

bain_i_modifier_desc;We are ruled by Bain, first of his name, King of Gramavuld!\n\nAfter taking the throne in TA 2977 with the death of his father, Bard I, Bain was left with an unfinished kingdom. His father had meant to unite the Northmen of Gramavuld under the leadership of the House of Bard, but the Grammas, the Northmen of the plains of Gramavuld, and the Rivermen, the Northmen on the northmen shores of the Celduin, had not fully sworn fealty to the realm.\n\nOver the years of his reign, Bain led both diplomatic and military campaigns against the Grammas and Rivermen, fulfilling his father's legacy, and cementing the House of Bard's rule over Gramavuld. Twelve years into his reign, in TA 2989, Balin and his company came to Dale requesting support in their expedition to retake Moria. Bain provided no troops, but helped supply the Dwarves.\n\nIn TA 3007, the realm had been at peace for a handful of years, and Bain could finally rest. He was succeeded by his son, Brand I.;x

brand_i_modifier_desc;We are ruled by Brand, first of of his name, King of the Barding Realm!\n\nWhen Brand took the throne in TA 3007, he inherited a powerful kingdom that had seen some years of peace. Over his father's reign, there had been messages coming from the south, warning of the growing power of Sauron and his allies. As such, Brand began to forge alliances with the independent peoples south of the Celduin. Some joined the realm, while others remained as military allies, ready to come to each others aid should war break out.\n\nIn TA 3017, the war looming in Brand's mind started to come into fruition. He received messengers from Mordor, requesting information regarding the Ring of Power and Bilbo Baggins.\n\nEven under the threat of war and ruin, Brand refused to cooperate, and Easterlings started to gather in the Logathavuld borderlands. In TA 3019, the Easterling host crossed into Gramavuld. Brand met them on the field with Dain I but was defeated and pushed back to Dale. During the ensuing Battle of Dale, Brand was slain in battle on March 17th, TA 3019.\n\nHis son Bard would take up command of the Barding army, and would refuse to be coronated until the kingdom had been freed, and war had been won.;x

bard_ii_modifier_desc;We are ruled by Bard, second of his name, King of the Barding Realm!\n\nBard would become the de-facto King in TA 3019 with his father's death in battle. After the breaking of the Seige of Dale, Bard vowed to lead the kingdom to victory before he would be worthy of the throne. As such, he was not coronated until the first year of the Fourth Age, when the Easterlings had been driven from Gramavuld, and the war had been won.\n\nAround the same time, King Aragorn Elessar's was crowned king of the Reuntied Kingdom. Bard sent an ambassador to Aragorn's coronation, and maintained friendly relationships with the Dûnedain through his entire reign.\n\nYears after taking the throne and the kingdom had recovered strength, Bard began to mount invasions into the Easterling lands in Logathavuld. By his death in FA 48 (TA 3067), Bard had greatly expanded the kingdom.;x
