############################;x
annex_lossarnach_title;Royal Acquisition of Lossarnach;x
annex_lossarnach_desc;To fight the coming §MShadow§!, our feudal kingdom needs to centralize. We will start with our closest substate: §GLossarnach§!.;x
annex_lebennin_title;Restructure Eastern Territories;x
annex_lebennin_desc;After our annexation of Lossarnach, our next focus is the Eastern half of our realm. The lands of §GLebennin§! are close enough that we can centralize it to royal authority. Despite the rest of "Central Gondor" being beyond any reasonable reach of our centralization for the moment, that does not mean that we cannot restructure it.;x
tolfalas_question_title;The Tolfalas Question;x
tolfalas_question_desc;In addition to the Eastern half of Gondor, there is the question of the Isle of Tolfalas.;x
da_independence_war_title;The Tolfalas Insult;x
da_independence_war_desc;Our overlords in Minas Tirith have chosen to ignore our claims to the Isle of Tolfalas. While they may think that that was the right choice for the §MRealm of Gondor§!, we will proove them wrong...\n\n§BThis decision will start an independence war. §RIf you lose, you will be annexed.§!;x
annex_lamedon_title;Integrate Lamedon;x
annex_lamedon_desc;Our centralization policies have become strong enough to allow us to easily integrate §GLamedon§! under royal authority.;x
annex_anfalas_title;Incorporate Anfalas;x
annex_anfalas_desc;With the newest edicts out of $CAPITAL$, it has been declared that much of Anfalas is rightfully owned by the $MONARCHTITLE$. As such, we can now more easily centralize Anfalas.;x
annex_dol_amroth_title;The End of a Princedom;x
annex_dol_amroth_desc;The §GPrincipality of Dol Amroth§!, formally created in the most modern sense in T.A 2044, has been a substate of our kingdom for the almost entirety of its existence. After many meetings and intense discussion, it has finally been decided that the Principality will be no more; it will fall under royal authority as all the rest of the fiefdoms.;x
annex_andrast_title;Inherit Andrast;x
annex_andrast_desc;The land in the Fiefdom of Andrast has been hard fought for. A motion has been made in $CAPITAL$ to fully take control of §GAndrast§!. We are centralized enough that this will not be a burden on our administrative system.;x
houses_of_healing_title;Houses of Healing;x
houses_of_healing_desc;The houses of healing of Minas Tirith as famed in the realm for their ability to heal the sick and wounded - they have saved countless lives of our soldiers.;x
gondorification_of_DRU_title;Gondorification of Drúadan Forest;x
gondorification_of_DRU_desc;Since the Drúedain of Drúadan Forest rebelled, our grip on the region has strengthened. A national edict was administered, meant to increase Gondorian immigration and Drúedain assimilation in the region. It took some time, but the edict did it's job - the Drúedain's numbers have become small enough that their claim doesn't matter.;x
stonewain_valley_title;Stonewain Valley;x
stonewain_valley_desc;A road, four horses wide, had been made in ancient days by the Men of Gondor. Since then, the road had become overgrown as forgotten. Only the Drúedain remember of its existence. If the Drúedain of Druadan Forest are in our good graces, they may show us this path.;x

gondor_military_resurgence_title;Gondor Military Resurgence;x
gondor_military_resurgence_desc;It has been long since the days of Gondor's greatest military prowess. However, the Gondorian armies have grown to a point to which our neighbors tremble in fear of our armies!\n\n§RExpansion flavor is locked behind this decision§!;x
andrast_territory_title;Reclamation of the Andrast Territory;x
andrast_territory_desc;Not long ago, Andrast was another one of Gondor's Fiefdoms. However, in the recent past, the Gondorian influence and presence in the region has made our claims tenuous at best. Despite, this, many Gondorians still live in the region. It is time they rejoin the fold.;x
andrast_war_end_GON_title;The Andrast Territory;x
andrast_war_end_GON_desc;As to be expected, we were able to occupy eastern Andrast without an issue, and now have unquestioned control over the region.\n\n§RThis will spawn Andrast in and make it your puppet§!;x

all_of_andrast_title;All of Andrast;x
all_of_andrast_desc;Centuries ago, the §GFiefdom of Andrast§! occupied all of the land west of the Lefnui, across the Andrast Mountains, to the shores of the Belegaer. It is time the territory is fully reunited.;x

andrast_war_2_end_GON_desc;The entirety of the Fiefdom of Andrast has been wretched back into our control. The capital of the region should move to its historical capital, Tharagrondost.\n\n§RIf you have taken the decision to annex Andrast, you will also inherit and core their land§!;x
andrast_war_2_end_PUK_title;Reclaim Andrast!;x
andrast_war_2_end_PUK_desc;In the past, Gondor may have defeated us. However, this time, we have prevailed!\n\n§RThis will return all of Andrast to you and ensure that Gondor cannot claim Andrast via flavor again.§!;x
gondorian_andrast_migration_title;Gondorian Andrast;x
gondorian_andrast_migration_desc;Now that we have occupied the entirety of the Andrast Territory, Gondorians need to reinhabit the region. There are some there already, but the lands are crawling with Drúedain tribesmen. In many cases, they outnumber the number of Gondorians living in the region. This must change.\n\n§RWhen you state the provinces of Andrast, the cores of the Drúedain of Púkel's Land will be removed§!;x
druadan_forest_rebellion_end_GON_title;The End of the Drúadan Forest Rebellion;x

return_to_south_gondor_desc;In the past, Gondorian armies marched through South Gondor, the region which other realms call "Harondor", as they would through Anórien - a friendly land filled with Gondorians. It has been hundreds of years since our armies were defeated and fled the lands. It is time that we begin to extend back into South Gondor;x
south_gondor_coastal_expansion_title;South Gondor Coastal Expansion;x
south_gondor_coastal_expansion_desc;It will take more time to reacquire the central steppes of South Gondor. However, much of the coastal regions remain unclaimed by nearby realms. We should reacquire them.;x
south_gondor_steppes_title;South Gondor Steppes;x
south_gondor_steppes_desc;There is not much in the steppes of South Gondor. The resources are lacking, and the important towns are few and far between. It is of no matter - it is part of South Gondor and we claim it!;x
reconquer_south_gondor_title;Reconquer South Gondor;x
reconquer_south_gondor_desc;We have reclaimed all of South Gondor that is otherwise unclaimed. However, there are still sections of South Gondor that other realms control.

annex_south_gondor_title;Annex South Gondor;x

accept_harnedan_title;The Peoples of Harondor;x
accept_harnedan_desc;Many inhabitants of South Gondor are of both Gondorian and Haradrim descent - they are the sons of the Gondorian settlers who came to South Gondor in the past.

encourage_outside_military_recruitment_title;Encourage Outside Military Recruitment;x
encourage_outside_military_recruitment_desc;The Gondorian armies are dwindling. The people, weary of war, are not volunteering as much as they have in the past. The Orc raids in Ithilien, paired with the Corsair attacks along the coast have made the situation untenable. If something does not change soon, Gondor's armies will be completely depleted.;x
