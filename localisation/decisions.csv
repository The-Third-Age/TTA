annex_lossarnach_desc;To fight the coming §MShadow§!, our feudal kingdom needs to centralize. We will start with our closest substate: §GLossarnach§!.;x
annex_lebennin_title;Restructure Eastern Territories;x
annex_lebennin_desc;After our annexation of Lossarnach, our next focus is the Eastern half of our realm. The lands of §GLebennin§! are close enough that we can centralize it to royal authority. Despite the rest of "Central Gondor" being beyond any reasonable reach of our centralization for the moment, that does not mean that we cannot restructure it.;x

da_independence_war_title;The Tolfalas Insult;x
da_independence_war_desc;Our overlords in Minas Tirith have chosen to ignore our claims to the Isle of Tolfalas. While they may think that that was the right choice for the §MRealm of Gondor§!, we will proove them wrong...\n\n§BThis decision will start an independence war. §RIf you lose, you will be annexed.§!;x
annex_lamedon_title;Integrate Lamedon;x
annex_lamedon_desc;Our centralization policies have become strong enough to allow us to easily integrate §GLamedon§! under royal authority.;x
annex_anfalas_title;Incorporate Anfalas;x
annex_anfalas_desc;With the newest edicts out of $CAPITAL$, it has been declared that much of Anfalas is rightfully owned by the $MONARCHTITLE$. As such, we can now more easily centralize Anfalas.;x
annex_dol_amroth_title;The End of a Princedom;x
annex_dol_amroth_desc;The §GPrincipality of Dol Amroth§!, formally created in the most modern sense in T.A 2044, has been a substate of our kingdom for the almost entirety of its existence. After many meetings and intense discussion, it has finally been decided that the Principality will be no more; it will fall under royal authority as all the rest of the fiefdoms.\n\n§RThis decision is only available to those with familial ties to the House of Dol Amroth: Denethor II, Boromir II and Faramir I;x
annex_andrast_title;Annex Andrast;x
annex_andrast_desc;The land in the Fiefdom of Andrast has been hard fought for. A motion has been made in $CAPITAL$ to fully take control of §GAndrast§!. We are centralized enough that this will not be a burden on our administrative system.;x
houses_of_healing_title;Houses of Healing;x
houses_of_healing_desc;The houses of healing of Minas Tirith as famed in the realm for their ability to heal the sick and wounded - they have saved countless lives of our soldiers.;x
restore_crossroads_fallen_king_title;Restore the Cross-roads of the Fallen King;x
restore_crossroads_fallen_king_desc;It has been too long since Gondor truly controlled the crossing of the north-south Harad Road and the east-west road between Osgiliath and Minas Morgul. The statue of one of our king has been befouled by the Orcs of Mordor, it's head knocked off and replaced with a symbol of their darkness. With the Orc raids finally stopped, now we can restore the Crossroads to their former glory.;x
destroy_crossroads_fallen_king_title;Destroy the Cross-roads of the Fallen King;x
destroy_crossroads_fallen_king_desc;In the recent past, the Crossroads of the Fallen King had been restored. If we so choose, we can destroy the statue.;x
stonewain_valley_desc;A road, four horses wide, had been made in ancient days by the Men of Gondor. Since then, the road had become overgrown as forgotten. Only the Drúedain remember of its existence. If the Drúedain of Druadan Forest are in our good graces, they may show us this path.;x
clear_stonewain_valley_title;Stonewain Valley Clean Up;x
clear_stonewain_valley_desc;The country that requested access to Stonewain Valley is no longer at war. The modifier can be removed.;x
end_orc_raids_title;End the Orc Raids;x
end_orc_raids_desc;With the recapture of Minas Ithil (formally known as Minas Morgul), the Orc raids in Ithilien have severely decreased to little more than a nuisance.;x
rebuild_osgiliath_title;Rebuild Osgiliath;x
rebuild_osgiliath_desc;Osgiliath was once the Jewel of Gondor. Founded on both sides of the Anduin by Isildur and Anárion, Osgiliath was once the seat of power of Gondor, being both the capital and housing the Osgiliath-stone. Over time, the city was abandoned and the site of many battles. Since the orc raids have been pushed back, more people have been flocking to the fledgling city. Enough, in fact, that reconstruction efforts are needed.;x
rebuild_dome_of_stars_title;Rebuild the Dome of Stars;x
rebuild_dome_of_stars_desc;At one point, Osgilaith held one of the palantíri in the Dome of Stars. However, this was not the only use of the building - it also served as an observatory. We may not have the Osgiliath-stone, but we can rebuild this wonder.;x
repopulate_ithilien_title;Repopulate Ithilien;x
repopulate_ithilien_desc;With the orc raids stopped, Harondor secured and Minas Ithil cleansed, we can finally restore the Land of the Moon to it's former glory.;x
expand_the_mesta_title;Expand the Mesta;x
expand_the_mesta_desc;With the recent success of the Mesta in Anfalas, it has been suggested that similar guilds be established across $COUNTRY$.\n\n§RFor every province that gets the modifier, you will lose 10k. 500k was arbitrarily chosen as the amount needed to take the decision - it has no effect on how much money you will actually spend!§!;x
recognize_college_of_spoken_word_title;Recognize the College of the Spoken Word;x
recognize_college_of_spoken_word_desc;Minas Tirith has some of the most glorious libraries in $COUNTRY$, even in the world of Men. Within these hushed halls, a group of loremasters, known as the College of the Spoken Word, meet regularly and share information. Unlike other Loremasters, whose noses are usually stuck up in old books, these Men travel the realm, converse with the people, take notes of the world, and bring these observations back for discussion and documentation.;x
gondor_military_resurgence_title;Gondor Military Resurgence;x
gondor_military_resurgence_desc;It has been long since the days of Gondor's greatest military prowess. However, the Gondorian armies have grown to a point to which our neighbors tremble in fear of our armies!\n\n§RExpansion flavor is locked behind this decision§!;x
expand_minasdirath_title;Expand the Minasdirath;x
expand_minasdirath_desc;The Minasdirath, otherwise known as the Order of the Guard, is a military order that all beacon guards belong to. Besides remaining vigilant and protecting/lighting beacons, members of the Minasdirath also conscripts young men from nearby villages and trains them to be beacon-guards to help ease up on the soldier shortage. Normally, only two to three men are trained in this manner for any given beacon per year. With some extra gear and funding, we can expand this program to train even more men in this method annually. It will surely help us fill the ranks of the professional military.;x

andrast_territory_desc;Not long ago, Andrast was another one of Gondor's Fiefdoms. However, in the recent past, the Gondorian influence and presence in the region has made our claims tenuous at best. Despite this, many Gondorians still live in the region. It is time they rejoin the fold.;x

puppet_druwaith_iaur_desc;Long ago, the region of Drúwaith Iaur was a fiefdom of our great realm. Since, then it has fallen into an almost unsettled state. Generally speaking, only Wildmen tribes roam the land, leaving it relatively lawless. It is time for us to return.;x

gondorification_of_DRU_desc;Since the Drúedain of Drúadan Forest rebelled, our grip on the region has strengthened. A national edict was administered, meant to increase Gondorian immigration and Drúedain assimilation in the region. It took some time, but the edict did it's job - the Drúedain's numbers have become small enough that their claim doesn't matter.;x

return_to_south_gondor_desc;In the past, Gondorian armies marched through South Gondor, the region which other realms call "Harondor", as they would through Anórien - a friendly land filled with Gondorians.

declare_steward_king_desc;It has been centuries since the "Kingdom" of Gondor was ruled by a King.

visit_tomb_of_elendil_desc;One of the traditions of the leaders of Gondor is to visit the tomb of her founder, Elendil the Tall. When the northern half of the realm was given to the Éothéod, turning it into the Kingdom of Rohan, the Steward Cirion removed the casket and was placed in the Hallows of Minas Tirith. Despite this, the tomb still remained a memorial and place of reverence for the people of Gondor.\n\n§RThis decision can be taken once per leader§!.;x
restore_haudh_in_gwanur_title;Restore the Haudh in Gwanûr;x
restore_haudh_in_gwanur_desc;The Haudh in Gwanûr is the burial site of two Rohirrim princes, Folcred and Fastred. These two men were the twin sons of Folcwine of Rohan, who came to Gondor in her hour of need in T.A. 2885. They rought along side Gondor's armies and their fellow Rohirrim, falling in defense of Ithilien. The brothers were buried in the barrow tradition of the Rohirrim near the crossings of the Poros, fittingly named, the Haudh in Gwanûr, Sindarin for "mound of the brothers".\n\nSince the site was created, there have been numerous raids and fights across Ithilien, and the burial ground has been damage. It is only right that we repair it.;x

encourage_outside_military_recruitment_desc;The Gondorian armies are dwindling. The people, weary of war, are not volunteering as much as they have in the past.

strengthen_anduin_river_crossings_desc;Minas Tirith, with her White Tower, shines like a beacon to all of Gondor. That beacon is under threat of being dimmed by the Orcs roaming Ithilien. One way to help prevent this fate is to build up the defenses along the Crossings of the Anduin - at Cair Andros, Osgiliath and the islets at the Mouth of the Anduin.\n\n§RAfter 10 years, any of the 4 provinces Cair Andros, West Osgiliath, Tol Forethir, and Benish Armon that are owned by $COUNTRY$ or our puppets will have level 6 forts built (only level 3 forts can be built via tech)\n\nThis decision is only available to Ecthelion II and Denethor II§!;x

build_rammas_echor_desc;A great wall, over 10 leagues in length, encircles the towns of within the Pelennor. Many of them are utterly defenseless, no walls or militia of any kind, relying on Minas Tirith, Osgiliath and the river crossings to protect them. Should any of those fall, they would be in great peril. With the construction of increased defenses along the Andruin Crossings, it would be prudent to ensure an extra layer of protection for these hamlets.\n\n§RAfter 5 years, Pelennor will have a level 6 fort built (only level 3 forts can be built via tech)\n\nThis decision is only available to Ecthelion II and Denethor II§!;x

thorongils_advice_desc;Of all the advice Thorongil has given, much of it focuses on the Corsairs of Umbar and the threat of their fleet. Their fleet has the potential to ruin Gondor's economy. While the Gondorian fleet currently may not be strong enough to sink the Corsair fleet, increasing resources devoted to new ship techniques can help level the playing fields..\n\n§RThe modifier will last until Thorongil leaves.§!\n\n§RThis decision is only available to Ecthelion II§!;x

restore_bar_iaur_dinen_title;Restore the Bar Iaur Dínen;x
restore_bar_iaur_dinen_desc;The Bar Iaur Dínen, otherwise known as the Old Silent Home, was a royal Manor on Tolfalas. Situated on the northern, most remote part of Tolfalas, the manor was used as a hunting grounds for Kings since its construction in TA 842. Following the end of the Kin-Strife in TA 1447, the manor was occasionally used as Corsair outposts, until the Corsairs were driven off of Tolfalas in TA 1810.\n\nFor another 130 years, Bar Iaur Dínen was used as a royal manor, until the Gondorian miltary abandoned the fortification.
