MILITARY_MOBILIZE_DESC;Apart from our standing army, our country can also, in the event of war, draw upon additional resources in the form of conscript levies. By ordering the militias to be raised, our conscript armies will begin amassing at major population centers, and begin preparations for full out war. While mobilization may be essential to overcoming a sizable enemy invasion, we must always be wary of its impact on the national economy.;x
MILITARY_DEMOBILIZE;Send the militias home;x
MILITARY_DEMOBILIZE_DESC;By giving the order to stand down, our conscript armies will leave the field of battle and return to their homes. While any country ravaged by the tribulations of war certainly longs for a return to normalcy, we would do well to first ensure that the war is won, before sheathing our sword.;x
