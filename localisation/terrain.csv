white_mountains;§gWhite Mountains§!\n\nAlso known as the Ered Nimrais, meaning 'Mountains of the White Horns', the snow-capped mountainrange reaches from the tip of Andrast in the West to the height of the Mindolluin in the East and makes up a impenetrable barrier between the populated parts of Gondor and the Lands of Calenardhon to the North. Many of Gondors and Rohans freshwater streams originate in the fringes of these peaks to flow into the Sea of Belegaer or become a tributary of the Great River Anduin;x

anorien;§GPlains of Anórien§!\n\nFounded in the year 3320 of the Second Age, Anórien, meaning 'Land of the Sun' is a temperate region laying between the White Mountains to the South, the Mering Stream to the West and the Entwash to the North. Its boundaries reach the Great River Anduin to the East. Fertile farmlands and soft woodlands stretch the land and it experienced settlement by men as early as the Elder Days. Some of the greatest works of Númenórean architecture ever seen, such as Minas Tirith and Osgiliath, are located here.;x
anorien_woods;§GWoods of Anórien§!\n\nA mix of temperate decidous and coniferous woodwork can be found here as the climate allows for four the four seasons typical for the altitude Anórien lies in.;x
osgiliath;§gOsgiliath§!\n\nThe city also known as the 'Citadel of the Stars' was founded at the End of the Second Era by Anárion and Isildur at both shore banks of the Anduin and lies halfway between Minas Tirith and Minas Ithil. The city halves are connected via a great bridge that was expanded and enlargened over time as well as support for the Dome of the Stars housing the Osgiliath Palantíri. Some time after its founding it was designated as capital of the Kingdom of Gondor and Royal seat of kings, who would reign from the Great Hall. The decline of the city began, when the city was sacked during the Kin-strife year 1437 of the Third Age and years later the Great Plague 1636 TA marking the slow depopulation and eventual abandonment in 2475 TA after being overrun.;x
druadan_forest;§GDrúadan Forest§!\n\nThe small pine forest located in Southeast Anórien grew around the beacon-hill of Eilenach and is named after the indigenous inhabitants of wild-men. The Great Road straddles the Northern Outskirts of these woods and a small forgotten pathway leads through the southern part of it.;x
cair_andros;§gCair Andros§!\n\A large narrow ship-shaped river island located in the middle of the Anduin holds a very important strategic position for whoever attempts to hold the banks of the Great River. At the northern tip the island ends in sharp rocks, that split the water like the bow of a ship creating the foam that serves as the namegiver of 'Ship of Long-foam'. During the Third Age fortications have been erected there that at some point were abandoned again.;x
minas_tirith;§gMinas Tirith§!\n\nOriginally founded by the name of Minas Anor - 'Tower of the Sun' in 3320 of the Second Age, holds a long unbroken history as the watchful guard looming over the fields of Pelennor and as the Bastion of Gondor against the numerous threats it faces. Situated on the Hill of the Guard at the "knee" of Mount Mindolluin, it consists of seven concentric layers that have gradually been expanded upon with a outer City Wall constructed of the same indestructible black rock of the Orthanc. At the top of the city lays the Citadel and the White Tree with a more recent addition of the White Tower. In TA 1636, the capital was moved from Osgiliath to Minas Anor under reasons of defensibility and slow desolation of former. It's name translates from Sindarin as 'Tower of Guard'.;x
pelennor_fields;§GPelennor Fields§!\n\n Outside of the two great cities, inbetween Minas Tirith and Osgiliath lie stretches of fertile farmland and hills dotted with townships and villages and since TA 2954 surrounded by the fortification of the Rammas Echor giving the lands the name Pelennor, meaning 'fenced land'. ;x
harlond_gondor;§gHarlond§!\n\nSome 4 to 5 miles south of the White City lies its harbour that allows for frequent waterway traffic with the Rest of Gondor and the World. It is protected by the Rammas Echor. Its name translates as 'Southern Haven'.;x
