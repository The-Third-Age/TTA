GC_DESC;Year 2954, of the Third Age. It is a time of great sorrow for the Men of the West. In the past year, both King Fengel of Rohan and Steward Turgon have died. In TA 2951, Sauron declared his return to Mordor, started rebuilding his Dark Tower of Barad-dûr and sent three Nazgûl off to unknown places. In the north, Goblin raids have slowly been increasing, despite their losses in the Battle of the Five Armies. The Elves, as always, look to their own borders, caring not for the troubles of Men, and the Dwarves delve ever deeper into their mountains, too concerned about their riches to be of help. A new great Calamity is coming.;x
